WEBVTT

00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:02.589
We're going to the Vale.

00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:04.075
You're taking me
to your sister's.

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:07.390
Tell me, Lady Stark, when was
the last time you saw your sister?

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.958
Jon was a man of peace.

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:11.594
He was Hand for 17 years.
Why kill him?

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:17.699
Do you want to see Viserys sitting
on the Iron Throne?

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:20.001
No. My brother
couldn't lead an army

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:21.970
even if my husband
gave him one.

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:23.404
He'll never take us home.

00:00:23.438 --> 00:00:25.873
The whore is pregnant.

00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:28.377
- She dies.
- I will have no part in it.

00:00:28.412 --> 00:00:31.814
You will do as I command or I'll
find me a Hand who will.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.550
You bring him here?

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:36.352
You pollute my home
with his presence?

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:39.521
- Is that the bad man?
- Lysa: He killed your father.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:42.624
- He murdered the Hand of the King!
- This man is my prisoner.

00:00:42.658 --> 00:00:44.793
I will not
have him harmed.

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:46.562
My sister's guest
is weary.

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:48.831
Take him down below
so he can rest.

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.600
That's all
the realm is now:

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:53.871
Back-stabbing and scheming
and money-grubbing.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:55.840
I don't know
what holds it together.

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:59.111
Our marriage.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:02.882
I'll take you to see the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:05.551
She has his nose,
his black hair.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:07.187
King Robert's bastards--

00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:09.223
Jon Arryn tracked
them all down. Why?

00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:10.858
He was the King's Hand.

00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:13.394
Perhaps Robert was overcome
with fatherly love.

00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:16.497
- Jaime: I'm looking for my brother.
- He was taken at my command.

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.000
Take him alive.
Kill his men.

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:25.539
- Yah!
- Aah!

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:27.942
My brother, Lord Stark--
we want him back.

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.257
Your pardon, Your Grace.

00:03:57.291 --> 00:03:59.392
I would rise, but...

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:01.828
Do you know what
your wife has done?

00:04:03.163 --> 00:04:05.332
She did nothing
I did not command.

00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:07.100
Who'd have thought
she had it in her?

00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:09.169
By what right dare you lay
hands on my blood?

00:04:09.204 --> 00:04:10.764
I am the King's Hand, charged
with keeping the peace...

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:12.391
You were the King's Hand.

00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:14.409
You shall now be held
accountable.

00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:16.445
Oh, will both of you
shut your mouths?!

00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:22.084
Catelyn will release Tyrion and
you'll make your peace with Jaime.

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:23.819
He butchered my men--

00:04:23.853 --> 00:04:26.322
Lord Stark was
returning drunk

00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:28.790
from a brothel
when his men attacked Jaime.

00:04:28.824 --> 00:04:32.394
- Quiet, woman.
- Jaime has fled the city.

00:04:32.428 --> 00:04:35.363
Give me leave to bring him
back to justice.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.134
I took you for a King.

00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:41.236
- Hold your tongue.
- He's attacked

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.405
one of my brothers
and abducted the other.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.807
I should wear the armor
and you the gown.

00:04:58.087 --> 00:05:00.221
I shall wear this
like a badge of honor.

00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:06.594
Wear it in silence
or I'll honor you again.

00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:22.842
See what she does to me?

00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:25.845
My loving wife.

00:05:31.552 --> 00:05:33.887
I should not have
hit her.

00:05:33.921 --> 00:05:36.023
That was not...

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:39.326
That was not Kingly.

00:05:40.963 --> 00:05:43.765
If we don't act,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.101
there will be a war.

00:05:46.135 --> 00:05:50.004
So tell your wife to return
that little shit of an Imp

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.440
to King's Landing.

00:05:52.475 --> 00:05:55.143
She's had her fun,
now put an end to it.

00:05:56.613 --> 00:05:59.448
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.

00:05:59.482 --> 00:06:02.284
And what about
Jaime Lannister?

00:06:04.754 --> 00:06:07.590
- What about Jaime?
- I'm half a Kingdom in debt

00:06:07.624 --> 00:06:09.992
to his bloody father.

00:06:10.026 --> 00:06:13.930
I don't know what happened between
you and those yellow-haired shits.

00:06:13.964 --> 00:06:16.700
I don't want to know.
This is what matters--

00:06:16.734 --> 00:06:18.769
I can't rule the Kingdoms

00:06:18.803 --> 00:06:21.805
if the Starks and the Lannisters
are at each other's throats.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.074
So enough.

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:28.413
As you command,
Your Grace.

00:06:28.447 --> 00:06:30.916
With your leave,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.085
I will return to Winterfell
and set matters straight.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.021
Piss on that.
Send a raven.

00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:37.689
I want you to stay.

00:06:37.723 --> 00:06:40.793
I'm the King.
I get what I want.

00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:49.000
I never loved my brothers.

00:06:49.035 --> 00:06:52.738
A sad thing for a man
to admit, but it's true.

00:06:56.243 --> 00:06:58.611
You were the brother
I chose.

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.454
We'll talk when I return
from the hunt.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.424
The hunt?

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:14.862
Killing things
clears my head.

00:07:14.897 --> 00:07:17.632
You'll have to sit on the
throne while I'm away.

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:20.368
You'll hate it more than I do.

00:07:20.402 --> 00:07:22.136
The Targaryen girl--

00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:25.739
seven hells,
don't start with her again.

00:07:25.773 --> 00:07:28.609
The girl will die
and I'll hear no more of it.

00:07:28.643 --> 00:07:31.679
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it off again,

00:07:31.713 --> 00:07:35.816
I swear to the mother I'll pin the
damned thing on Jaime Lannister.

00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:59.355
Khaleesi?

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:03.726
Oh, Khaleesi!

00:09:14.873 --> 00:09:16.708
You're hurt.

00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:13.597
- Not too fast.
- Come on, Dancer.

00:10:13.631 --> 00:10:15.498
When are you gonna
tell him?

00:10:15.533 --> 00:10:17.601
Not now.

00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:19.403
- Blood for blood.
- Come on!

00:10:19.437 --> 00:10:21.938
You need to make the Lannisters
pay for Jory and the others.

00:10:21.972 --> 00:10:24.274
- You're talking about war.
- I'm talking about justice.

00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:26.543
Only the Lord of Winterfell

00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:28.545
can call in the bannermen
and raise an army.

00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:30.847
A Lannister put his spear
through your father's leg.

00:10:30.882 --> 00:10:33.884
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock
where no one can touch him--

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:35.787
you want me to march
on Casterly Rock?

00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:38.089
- You're not a boy anymore.
- Come on.

00:10:38.123 --> 00:10:41.092
They attacked your father.
They've already started the war.

00:10:41.126 --> 00:10:45.330
It's your duty to represent your
House when your father can't.

00:10:45.365 --> 00:10:49.001
And it's not your duty,
because it's not your House.

00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:01.112
Where's Bran?

00:11:03.349 --> 00:11:06.217
I don't know.
It's not my House.

00:11:38.683 --> 00:11:41.352
Robb?

00:11:41.386 --> 00:11:44.689
All alone in the deep,
dark woods.

00:11:47.693 --> 00:11:49.827
I'm not alone.
My brother is with me.

00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:51.562
I don't see him.

00:11:51.597 --> 00:11:53.564
Got him hidden
under your cloak?

00:11:53.598 --> 00:11:55.800
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

00:11:55.834 --> 00:11:58.469
- Silver.
- We'll take the pin

00:11:58.503 --> 00:12:01.772
and the horse.
Get down.

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:04.841
Be quick about it.

00:12:04.876 --> 00:12:06.310
I can't.

00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:08.412
The saddle--
the straps.

00:12:11.849 --> 00:12:14.918
What's wrong with you?
You some kind of cripple?

00:12:14.953 --> 00:12:16.621
I'm Brandon Stark
of Winterfell.

00:12:16.655 --> 00:12:18.890
If you don't let me be,
I'll have you all killed!

00:12:18.924 --> 00:12:21.559
Cut his little cock off
and stuff it in his mouth.

00:12:21.594 --> 00:12:23.962
The boy's
worth nothing dead.

00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:26.197
Benjen Stark's
own blood?

00:12:26.232 --> 00:12:29.501
Think what Mance
would give us.

00:12:29.535 --> 00:12:32.905
Piss on Mance Rayder
and piss on the North.

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:36.141
We're going as far South
as South goes.

00:12:36.175 --> 00:12:39.711
There ain't no White Walkers
down in Dorne.

00:12:39.746 --> 00:12:42.047
Drop the knife!

00:12:42.081 --> 00:12:45.050
Let him go and I'll let you live.

00:13:05.036 --> 00:13:07.037
Robb.

00:13:07.072 --> 00:13:09.974
- Robb.
- Shut up.

00:13:10.008 --> 00:13:12.309
Drop the blade!

00:13:12.344 --> 00:13:14.445
- No, don't.
- Do it.

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.850
Are you all right?

00:13:54.884 --> 00:13:57.620
Yes.
It doesn't hurt.

00:13:58.555 --> 00:14:00.523
Tough little lad.

00:14:00.557 --> 00:14:04.060
In the Iron Islands, you're not a man
until you've killed your first enemy.

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:05.695
Well done.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.597
Have you lost your mind?

00:14:08.632 --> 00:14:10.433
What if you'd missed?

00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:12.868
He would have killed you
and cut Bran's throat.

00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:15.504
- You don't have the right--
- To what, to save your brother's life?

00:14:15.538 --> 00:14:18.406
It was the only thing
to do, so I did it.

00:14:20.242 --> 00:14:22.176
What about her?

00:14:27.983 --> 00:14:31.019
Give me my life,
My Lord, and I'm yours.

00:14:32.888 --> 00:14:34.789
We'll keep her alive.

00:14:58.713 --> 00:15:00.514
Mord!

00:15:00.548 --> 00:15:03.784
Turnkey!
Mord!

00:15:05.086 --> 00:15:07.221
Mord!

00:15:11.027 --> 00:15:13.162
Dwarf man
making noise!

00:15:15.732 --> 00:15:17.466
How would you like
to be rich?

00:15:17.501 --> 00:15:20.002
Dwarf man still
making noise.

00:15:20.905 --> 00:15:22.572
My family is rich.

00:15:22.606 --> 00:15:24.340
We have gold,
lots of gold.

00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:26.909
I'm prepared to give you
lots of gold in--

00:15:29.413 --> 00:15:31.447
No gold!

00:15:31.481 --> 00:15:33.482
Well, I don't
have it here.

00:15:33.517 --> 00:15:35.918
No gold.

00:15:35.952 --> 00:15:37.653
Fuck off.

00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:05.816
I don't want
to practice today.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.184
No?

00:16:08.219 --> 00:16:10.621
They killed Jory.

00:16:10.655 --> 00:16:13.557
My father is hurt.

00:16:13.592 --> 00:16:16.093
I don't care about
stupid wooden swords.

00:16:16.128 --> 00:16:17.961
You are troubled.

00:16:17.996 --> 00:16:19.663
- Yes.
- Good!

00:16:19.697 --> 00:16:21.932
Trouble is the perfect
time for training.

00:16:21.967 --> 00:16:25.269
When you are dancing in the meadow
with your dolls and kittens,

00:16:25.304 --> 00:16:27.238
this is not
when fighting happens.

00:16:27.273 --> 00:16:29.541
I don't like
dolls and k--

00:16:30.409 --> 00:16:32.477
You're not here.

00:16:33.446 --> 00:16:35.481
You're with
your trouble.

00:16:35.515 --> 00:16:38.250
If you are with your trouble
when fighting happens--

00:16:42.356 --> 00:16:44.124
--More trouble for you.

00:16:44.158 --> 00:16:46.359
Just so.

00:16:47.728 --> 00:16:50.429
How can you be
quick as a snake...

00:16:54.368 --> 00:16:56.635
...Or as quiet
as a shadow...

00:17:00.907 --> 00:17:03.709
...When you are
somewhere else?

00:17:06.212 --> 00:17:08.347
You are fearing
for your father, hmm?

00:17:10.516 --> 00:17:12.851
That is right.

00:17:12.886 --> 00:17:16.121
- Do you pray to the gods?
- The old and the new.

00:17:17.791 --> 00:17:20.460
There is only one God

00:17:20.494 --> 00:17:23.397
and his name is Death.

00:17:23.431 --> 00:17:26.433
And there is only one thing
we say to Death:

00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:29.536
"Not today."

00:17:37.813 --> 00:17:40.148
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!

00:17:40.182 --> 00:17:42.751
- Khalakka Dothrae!
- Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!

00:17:42.785 --> 00:17:45.186
- Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!
- Khalakka Dothrae!

00:17:54.963 --> 00:17:57.030
She has to eat
the whole heart?

00:17:57.999 --> 00:17:59.866
I hope that wasn't
my horse.

00:17:59.901 --> 00:18:01.735
She's doing well.

00:18:01.769 --> 00:18:03.770
She'll never
keep it down.

00:18:03.805 --> 00:18:05.939
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!

00:18:05.974 --> 00:18:08.475
Khalakka Dothrae!

00:18:08.574 --> 00:18:09.770
Khalakka Dothrae!

00:18:27.196 --> 00:18:29.097
Tell me what she's saying.

00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:31.633
"The prince is riding.

00:18:31.667 --> 00:18:34.668
I have heard the thunder
of his hooves.

00:18:34.703 --> 00:18:37.104
Swift as the wind he rides.

00:18:38.539 --> 00:18:41.408
His enemies
will cower before him...

00:18:42.876 --> 00:18:46.379
And their wives will
weep tears of blood."

00:18:50.118 --> 00:18:52.253
She's going
to have a boy.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.626
He won't be
a real Targaryen.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.062
He won't be
a true Dragon.

00:19:50.448 --> 00:19:53.417
Vezh fin saja
rhaesheseres!

00:19:53.451 --> 00:19:56.553
"The stallion
who mounts the world."

00:19:56.588 --> 00:19:59.590
The stallion is
the Khal of Khals.

00:19:59.624 --> 00:20:02.726
He shall unite the people
into a single Khalasar.

00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:06.129
All the people of the world
will be his herd.

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:08.365
...Rhaesheseres!

00:20:08.399 --> 00:20:10.567
Rhaesheseres!

00:20:18.777 --> 00:20:21.278
Rhaego! Rhaego!

00:20:21.312 --> 00:20:23.447
Rhaego! Rhaego!

00:20:23.481 --> 00:20:26.249
Rhaego!
Rhaego...

00:20:32.389 --> 00:20:34.990
They love her.

00:20:37.593 --> 00:20:38.826
Rhaego! Rhaego!

00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:41.596
Rhaego!
Rhaego...

00:20:58.982 --> 00:21:02.084
She truly is
a queen today.

00:21:30.378 --> 00:21:33.881
Don't let them see you
carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.

00:21:33.915 --> 00:21:36.049
You know the law.

00:21:36.083 --> 00:21:38.051
It's not my law.

00:21:38.085 --> 00:21:40.054
They don't belong to you.

00:21:40.088 --> 00:21:42.490
Whatever is hers
is also mine.

00:21:43.392 --> 00:21:45.160
Once, perhaps.

00:21:47.096 --> 00:21:49.932
If I sell one egg,
I'll have enough to buy a ship.

00:21:49.966 --> 00:21:52.134
Two eggs-- a ship
and an army.

00:21:52.169 --> 00:21:55.471
- And you have all three.
- I need a large army.

00:21:56.841 --> 00:21:59.643
I'm the last hope
of a dynasty, Mormont.

00:21:59.677 --> 00:22:01.812
The greatest dynasty
this world has ever seen

00:22:01.846 --> 00:22:04.348
on my shoulders since
I was five years old--

00:22:04.382 --> 00:22:07.384
and no one has ever given me
what they gave to her in that tent.

00:22:07.418 --> 00:22:09.286
Never.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.554
Not a piece of it.

00:22:11.589 --> 00:22:14.257
How can I carry
what I need to carry without it?

00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:15.992
Hmm?

00:22:16.026 --> 00:22:18.460
Who can rule without wealth
or fear or love?

00:22:22.798 --> 00:22:26.703
Oh, you stand there,
all nobility and honor.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.576
You don't think I see you looking
at my little sister, hmm?

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.146
Don't think I know
what you want?

00:22:38.183 --> 00:22:41.086
I don't care.
You can have her.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.388
She can be Queen
of the savages and dine

00:22:43.423 --> 00:22:45.357
on the finest
bloody horseparts,

00:22:45.391 --> 00:22:48.193
and you can dine on whichever
parts of her you like.

00:22:49.528 --> 00:22:51.863
But let me go.

00:22:54.032 --> 00:22:55.533
You can go.

00:22:55.567 --> 00:22:57.401
You can't have the eggs.

00:22:57.435 --> 00:22:59.202
You swore
an oath to me.

00:22:59.237 --> 00:23:01.738
Does loyalty
mean nothing to you?

00:23:01.772 --> 00:23:03.940
It means everything to me.

00:23:03.974 --> 00:23:05.975
And yet here you stand.

00:23:06.009 --> 00:23:08.110
And yet here I stand.

00:23:24.061 --> 00:23:26.663
Mord!

00:23:26.697 --> 00:23:28.931
Mord!

00:23:31.334 --> 00:23:33.202
Mord!

00:23:36.907 --> 00:23:38.941
Mord!

00:23:39.943 --> 00:23:41.744
Mord.

00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:44.780
Noise again!

00:23:47.184 --> 00:23:49.986
- About the gold...
- No gold!

00:23:50.021 --> 00:23:52.456
- No gold.
- Listen to me!

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.558
Listen to me.

00:23:54.592 --> 00:23:56.794
Sometimes possession

00:23:56.828 --> 00:23:58.930
is an abstract concept--

00:24:00.967 --> 00:24:03.502
When they captured me,
they took my purse,

00:24:03.536 --> 00:24:05.504
but the gold
is still mine.

00:24:05.538 --> 00:24:07.306
Where?

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.441
Where?
I don't know where,

00:24:09.475 --> 00:24:10.775
but when they free me--

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.210
You want free?

00:24:13.145 --> 00:24:15.480
Go be free.

00:24:16.748 --> 00:24:18.916
Have you ever
heard the phrase

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.884
"rich as a Lannister"?

00:24:23.488 --> 00:24:25.489
Of course you have!

00:24:25.523 --> 00:24:28.459
You're a smart man.

00:24:28.493 --> 00:24:31.329
You know who
the Lannisters are.

00:24:32.231 --> 00:24:35.199
I am a Lannister.

00:24:35.234 --> 00:24:38.903
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

00:24:38.938 --> 00:24:43.009
And of course,
you have also heard the phrase,

00:24:43.043 --> 00:24:46.379
"a Lannister always
pays his debts."

00:24:48.182 --> 00:24:50.750
If you deliver
a message from me...

00:24:51.852 --> 00:24:55.221
to Lady Arryn,
I will be in your debt.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.326
I will owe you gold.

00:25:00.695 --> 00:25:02.829
If you deliver
the message

00:25:02.864 --> 00:25:06.700
and I live, which I very much
intend to do.

00:25:09.337 --> 00:25:11.138
What message?

00:25:17.812 --> 00:25:20.447
Tell her I wish
to confess my crimes.

00:25:26.822 --> 00:25:29.857
You wish to confess
your crimes?

00:25:29.892 --> 00:25:31.526
Yes, My Lady.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.094
I do, My Lady.

00:25:33.128 --> 00:25:36.464
The sky cells
always break them.

00:25:36.499 --> 00:25:38.700
Speak, Imp.

00:25:38.735 --> 00:25:41.136
Meet your gods
as an honest man.

00:25:45.941 --> 00:25:49.578
Where do I begin,
my lords and ladies?

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.748
I'm a vile man,

00:25:52.782 --> 00:25:54.683
I confess it.

00:25:54.717 --> 00:25:57.719
My crimes and sins
are beyond counting.

00:25:57.754 --> 00:26:00.889
I have lied
and cheated...

00:26:02.224 --> 00:26:04.359
gambled and whored.

00:26:06.062 --> 00:26:08.030
I'm not particularly
good at violence,

00:26:08.064 --> 00:26:11.500
but I'm good at convincing
others to do violence for me.

00:26:14.138 --> 00:26:16.272
You want specifics,
I suppose.

00:26:17.675 --> 00:26:20.210
When I was seven
I saw a servant girl

00:26:20.244 --> 00:26:22.212
bathing in the river.

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:24.114
I stole her robe.

00:26:24.148 --> 00:26:26.482
She was forced to return
to the castle

00:26:26.517 --> 00:26:28.517
naked and in tears.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.853
If I close my eyes,

00:26:31.888 --> 00:26:35.090
I can still see her tits bouncing.

00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:41.595
When I was 10 I stuffed
my Uncle's boots with goatshit.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.031
When confronted
with my crime,

00:26:44.065 --> 00:26:46.534
I blamed a squire.
Poor boy was flogged

00:26:46.568 --> 00:26:48.803
and I escaped justice.

00:26:48.837 --> 00:26:50.605
When I was 12

00:26:50.639 --> 00:26:53.641
I milked my eel
into a pot of turtle stew.

00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:56.712
I flogged the one-eyed snake.

00:26:56.746 --> 00:26:58.747
I skinned my sausage.

00:26:58.782 --> 00:27:01.984
I made the bald man cry

00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:04.020
into the turtle stew,

00:27:04.054 --> 00:27:06.055
which I do believe
my sister ate.

00:27:06.089 --> 00:27:08.024
At least I hope she did.

00:27:08.058 --> 00:27:10.392
Once I brought a jackass
and a honeycomb

00:27:10.427 --> 00:27:12.594
- into a brothel--
- Silence!

00:27:12.628 --> 00:27:14.229
What happened next?

00:27:15.231 --> 00:27:18.265
What do you think
you're doing?

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.234
Confessing my crimes.

00:27:20.268 --> 00:27:22.803
Lord Tyrion,
you are accused

00:27:22.837 --> 00:27:26.307
of hiring a man to slay
my son Bran in his bed,

00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:29.144
and of conspiring to murder
my sister's husband,

00:27:29.178 --> 00:27:33.015
Lord Jon Arryn,
the Hand of the King.

00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:35.384
Oh, I'm very sorry.

00:27:36.553 --> 00:27:38.488
I don't know anything
about all that.

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:41.859
You've had
your little joke.

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:44.262
I trust you enjoyed it.

00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:47.165
Mord, take him back
to the dungeon.

00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:49.533
But this time find
a smaller cell...

00:27:49.568 --> 00:27:51.669
With a steeper floor.

00:27:51.704 --> 00:27:54.472
Is this how justice

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.374
is done in the Vale?

00:27:56.408 --> 00:27:58.976
You accuse me
of crimes,

00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:02.179
I deny them,
so you throw me into a cell

00:28:02.213 --> 00:28:04.081
to freeze and starve?

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:07.051
Where is
the King's Justice?

00:28:07.085 --> 00:28:10.455
I am accused
and demand a trial!

00:28:12.191 --> 00:28:14.126
If you're tried
and found guilty,

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.263
then by the King's own laws
you will pay with your life.

00:28:17.297 --> 00:28:20.400
I understand the law.

00:28:20.434 --> 00:28:23.002
We have no executioner
in the Eyrie.

00:28:23.037 --> 00:28:25.839
Life is more elegant here.

00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:27.807
Open the moon door.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.429
You want a trial,
My Lord Lannister.

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:53.464
Very well.

00:28:53.499 --> 00:28:56.467
My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,

00:28:56.502 --> 00:28:58.769
and you will hear
his judgment.

00:28:58.804 --> 00:29:00.905
Then you will leave...

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.074
By one door
or the other.

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:06.310
No need to bother
Lord Robin.

00:29:06.345 --> 00:29:09.981
I demand a trial by combat.

00:29:18.624 --> 00:29:20.491
You have that right.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.461
My Lady, I beg the honor.

00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:25.463
Let me be your champion.

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:27.898
The honor should be mine.

00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:30.167
For the love I bore
your Lord husband,

00:29:30.202 --> 00:29:32.003
let me avenge his death.

00:29:32.037 --> 00:29:34.572
- I'll fight for you, My Lady.
- It'll be my honor.

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:37.941
- The honor should be mine.
- Make the bad man fly!

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.912
Ser Vardis...

00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:44.115
You're quiet.

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:46.049
Don't you want
to avenge my husband?

00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:50.621
With all my heart,
My Lady.

00:29:50.655 --> 00:29:52.589
But the Imp
is half my size.

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:55.758
It would be shameful to slaughter
such a man and call it justice.

00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:57.861
Agreed.

00:29:57.895 --> 00:30:00.830
You demanded
a trial by combat.

00:30:00.865 --> 00:30:04.200
Now I demand a champion.
I have that right, same as you.

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:06.202
My Lady,

00:30:06.236 --> 00:30:09.706
I will gladly fight
the Imp's champion for you.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.242
I wouldn't be
too glad, Ser.

00:30:12.276 --> 00:30:14.778
I name my brother
Jaime Lannister.

00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:17.013
The Kingslayer

00:30:17.048 --> 00:30:19.015
is hundreds of miles
from here.

00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:21.651
Send a raven for him.
I'm happy to wait.

00:30:22.553 --> 00:30:24.721
The trial will be today.

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:30.227
Do I have a volunteer?

00:30:38.037 --> 00:30:40.605
Anyone?

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.641
Anyone?

00:30:45.578 --> 00:30:47.879
I think we can assume
that no one is willing--

00:30:47.913 --> 00:30:49.948
I'll stand
for the dwarf.

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:03.560
More wine, Your Grace?

00:31:05.463 --> 00:31:07.998
- What was I saying?
- Renly: Simpler time.

00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:11.369
It was! It was.
You're too young to remember.

00:31:11.403 --> 00:31:13.104
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

00:31:13.139 --> 00:31:16.608
- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right  in the open,

00:31:16.643 --> 00:31:20.846
vicious as you like, all but
sending you a bloody invitation.

00:31:20.881 --> 00:31:22.849
Nothing like today.

00:31:22.883 --> 00:31:25.751
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

00:31:25.785 --> 00:31:28.153
Not as exhilarating
as those balls

00:31:28.188 --> 00:31:30.589
and masquerades
you like to throw.

00:31:35.528 --> 00:31:37.995
You ever fuck
a Riverlands girl?

00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:39.663
Once.
I think.

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:43.500
You think?
I think you'd remember.

00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:46.469
Back in our day,
you weren't a real man

00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:49.606
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.375
and the Riverlands.

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:54.645
- We used to call it "making the eight."
- Those were some lucky girls.

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:56.714
You ever make
the eight, Barristan?

00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:58.716
I don't believe so,
Your Grace.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.618
Those were the days.

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:02.420
Which days, exactly?

00:32:02.454 --> 00:32:05.957
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

00:32:05.991 --> 00:32:09.227
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:12.163
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

00:32:12.197 --> 00:32:15.566
Or way before that, when dragons
burned whole cities to the ground?

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.768
Easy, boy.

00:32:17.803 --> 00:32:20.771
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the King.

00:32:20.806 --> 00:32:22.540
I suppose it was all
rather heroic...

00:32:22.574 --> 00:32:25.409
If you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:28.078
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

00:32:32.184 --> 00:32:34.052
More wine, Your Grace?

00:32:50.104 --> 00:32:53.940
They burned most everything
in the Riverlands:

00:32:53.975 --> 00:32:58.144
Our fields;
Our granaries;

00:32:58.178 --> 00:33:00.580
our homes.

00:33:00.614 --> 00:33:04.750
They took our women,
then they took 'em again.

00:33:04.785 --> 00:33:07.386
When they was done,
they butchered them

00:33:07.421 --> 00:33:09.222
as if they was animals.

00:33:09.256 --> 00:33:11.391
They covered our children

00:33:11.426 --> 00:33:13.227
in pitch

00:33:13.261 --> 00:33:15.162
and lit them on fire.

00:33:16.331 --> 00:33:18.332
Brigands, most likely.

00:33:18.367 --> 00:33:20.736
They weren't thieves.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.372
They didn't steal
nothing.

00:33:23.406 --> 00:33:26.808
They even left something behind,
Your Grace.

00:33:26.843 --> 00:33:30.245
It's the King's Hand
you're addressing, not the King.

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:32.213
The King is hunting.

00:33:39.287 --> 00:33:43.524
Fish.
The Sigil of House Tully.

00:33:43.558 --> 00:33:47.328
Isn't that your wife's house--
Tully, My Lord Hand?

00:33:51.966 --> 00:33:55.402
These men,
were they flying a Sigil?

00:33:56.438 --> 00:33:59.206
- A banner?
- None, your--

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.841
Hand.

00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:02.709
The one who was
leading them...

00:34:02.744 --> 00:34:06.247
Taller by a foot
than any man I've ever met,

00:34:06.281 --> 00:34:09.617
saw him cut
the blacksmith in two,

00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:12.052
saw him take the head
off a horse

00:34:12.087 --> 00:34:14.589
with a single swing
of his sword.

00:34:14.623 --> 00:34:17.158
That sounds like
someone we know.

00:34:17.192 --> 00:34:19.294
The Mountain.

00:34:19.328 --> 00:34:22.397
You're describing
Ser Gregor Clegane.

00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:25.400
Why should Ser Gregor
turn brigand?

00:34:25.434 --> 00:34:27.601
The man is
an anointed knight.

00:34:27.636 --> 00:34:30.704
I've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

00:34:30.738 --> 00:34:32.974
I'm sure you have
as well.

00:34:33.008 --> 00:34:35.009
Can you think
of any reason

00:34:35.043 --> 00:34:36.844
the Lannisters
might possibly have

00:34:36.878 --> 00:34:38.546
for being angry
with your wife?

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.348
If the Lannisters

00:34:41.383 --> 00:34:43.684
were to order attacks
on villages

00:34:43.718 --> 00:34:45.953
under the King's
protection,

00:34:45.987 --> 00:34:48.756
- it would be--
- That would be almost as brazen

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.825
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.262
Well...

00:34:58.034 --> 00:35:00.402
I cannot give you
back your homes

00:35:00.436 --> 00:35:03.138
or restore
your dead to life,

00:35:03.173 --> 00:35:05.140
but perhaps I can
give you justice

00:35:05.175 --> 00:35:07.809
in the name of our King,
Robert.

00:35:07.844 --> 00:35:11.179
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

00:35:15.217 --> 00:35:18.920
You shall have the command.
Assemble 100 men

00:35:18.954 --> 00:35:22.657
- and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
- As you command.

00:35:29.731 --> 00:35:32.867
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

00:35:32.892 --> 00:35:32.901
the first of his name,

00:35:32.902 --> 00:35:36.772
King of the Andals and the First Men,
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

00:35:36.806 --> 00:35:39.041
and protector of the realm,

00:35:39.076 --> 00:35:41.310
I charge you to bring
the King's Justice

00:35:41.345 --> 00:35:43.380
to the false knight
Gregor Clegane

00:35:43.414 --> 00:35:45.882
and all those
who shared in his crimes.

00:35:45.917 --> 00:35:47.818
I denounce him

00:35:47.852 --> 00:35:49.820
and attaint him.

00:35:49.854 --> 00:35:53.156
I strip him of all
ranks and titles,

00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:56.859
of all lands and holdings,

00:35:56.894 --> 00:36:00.263
- and sentence him to death.
- My Lord...

00:36:00.297 --> 00:36:03.265
This-- this is
a drastic action.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.068
It would be better to wait
for King Robert's return.

00:36:06.103 --> 00:36:08.537
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My Lord.

00:36:08.572 --> 00:36:10.941
Send a raven
to Casterly Rock.

00:36:10.975 --> 00:36:14.311
Inform Tywin Lannister that
he has been summoned to court

00:36:14.346 --> 00:36:16.413
to answer for the crimes
of his bannermen.

00:36:16.448 --> 00:36:20.584
He will arrive within the fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown

00:36:20.618 --> 00:36:24.288
and a traitor
to the realm.

00:36:37.403 --> 00:36:40.272
A bold move, My Lord,
and admirable.

00:36:40.306 --> 00:36:42.841
But is it wise
to yank the lion's tail?

00:36:42.876 --> 00:36:46.378
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.449
Gold wins wars,
not soldiers.

00:36:50.483 --> 00:36:52.818
Then how come
Robert is King

00:36:52.852 --> 00:36:55.154
and not Tywin Lannister?

00:37:27.588 --> 00:37:31.191
Hold!

00:37:31.225 --> 00:37:33.461
- Attack attack!
- Come on, Ser Vardis!

00:37:33.495 --> 00:37:36.464
Attack!

00:37:39.701 --> 00:37:42.269
Stand and fight, coward!

00:38:42.699 --> 00:38:45.334
Yes!

00:38:47.337 --> 00:38:51.007
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

00:39:09.561 --> 00:39:12.329
What are you doing?
Get up!

00:39:12.364 --> 00:39:15.432
Get up, get up,
get up!

00:39:17.468 --> 00:39:19.670
Raise your sword.
Raise it!

00:39:22.974 --> 00:39:24.575
Get up, man!

00:39:24.609 --> 00:39:26.310
- On your feet!
- Get up!

00:39:26.344 --> 00:39:28.979
Get up and fight,
Ser Vardis!

00:39:42.926 --> 00:39:45.761
No! Have mercy!

00:40:10.388 --> 00:40:12.590
Is it over?

00:40:16.661 --> 00:40:19.663
You don't fight
with honor!

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.934
No.

00:40:26.604 --> 00:40:27.871
He did.

00:40:41.786 --> 00:40:43.653
Can I make
the little man fly now?

00:40:43.688 --> 00:40:45.622
Not this little man.

00:40:45.656 --> 00:40:48.024
This little man
is going home.

00:40:50.128 --> 00:40:52.128
I believe you have
something of mine.

00:41:12.083 --> 00:41:14.952
A Lannister always
pays his debts.

00:41:32.237 --> 00:41:35.788
You wear your hair like
a real southern lady now.

00:41:36.642 --> 00:41:39.777
Well, why shouldn't I?
We're in the South.

00:41:39.812 --> 00:41:43.148
It's important to remember where
you come from.

00:41:43.182 --> 00:41:46.418
I'm not sure your mother would
like these new styles.

00:41:46.452 --> 00:41:49.155
My mother isn't
from the North.

00:41:50.524 --> 00:41:52.358
I'm aware of that.

00:41:52.392 --> 00:41:54.193
Why do you care?

00:41:54.227 --> 00:41:55.895
Do you even have hair
under there?

00:41:55.929 --> 00:41:59.364
Yes.
I have hair.

00:41:59.399 --> 00:42:01.167
I've never seen it.

00:42:01.201 --> 00:42:03.335
Would you like to?

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.405
No.

00:42:07.308 --> 00:42:09.976
Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?

00:42:11.812 --> 00:42:14.380
I come from a very
small village in--

00:42:14.415 --> 00:42:15.682
Oh, wait.

00:42:15.716 --> 00:42:18.151
I just realized
I don't care.

00:42:18.185 --> 00:42:20.420
- Sansa--
- Septa.

00:42:20.454 --> 00:42:23.890
Now you are being rude.

00:42:29.596 --> 00:42:31.731
My prince.

00:42:34.035 --> 00:42:36.002
My prince.

00:42:36.037 --> 00:42:37.637
My Lady.

00:42:38.873 --> 00:42:41.207
I fear I have
behaved monstrously

00:42:41.242 --> 00:42:44.110
the past few weeks.

00:42:46.179 --> 00:42:48.280
With your permission?

00:43:00.692 --> 00:43:03.360
It's beautiful,

00:43:03.395 --> 00:43:05.462
like the one
your mother wears.

00:43:05.497 --> 00:43:07.464
You'll be queen someday.

00:43:07.498 --> 00:43:10.300
It's only fitting
you should look the part.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.475
Will you forgive me
for my rudeness?

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.446
There's nothing to forgive.

00:43:22.149 --> 00:43:24.851
You're My Lady.

00:43:24.885 --> 00:43:28.054
One day we'll be married
in the Throne Room.

00:43:28.088 --> 00:43:32.024
Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,

00:43:32.058 --> 00:43:34.326
from the last hearth
in the North

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.296
to the Salt Shore
in the South,

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:40.566
and you will be Queen
over all of them.

00:43:43.803 --> 00:43:46.237
I'll never
disrespect you again.

00:43:46.272 --> 00:43:49.474
I'll never be cruel
to you again.

00:43:49.508 --> 00:43:51.810
Do you understand me?

00:43:53.646 --> 00:43:55.881
You're My Lady now,

00:43:55.915 --> 00:43:59.351
from this day

00:43:59.385 --> 00:44:02.154
until my last day.

00:44:24.245 --> 00:44:26.346
Stop.

00:44:26.381 --> 00:44:28.949
- Stop!
- Whoa.

00:44:30.351 --> 00:44:32.885
- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.021
In a turnip cart?

00:44:35.055 --> 00:44:38.057
I'll find a ship heading
south in White Harbor.

00:44:39.125 --> 00:44:40.926
And you can afford that?

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.661
Some of my friends are more
generous than others.

00:44:43.696 --> 00:44:46.364
There's a thousand
girls like you in King's Landing.

00:44:46.399 --> 00:44:48.666
So I'll have
lots of company.

00:44:48.701 --> 00:44:50.402
Yes, you'll be
very popular...

00:44:50.436 --> 00:44:52.137
Until some fat lord
comes to visit

00:44:52.172 --> 00:44:54.039
with a big belly
and a little prick

00:44:54.074 --> 00:44:56.576
and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:59.479
And what will happen
to me if I stay here?

00:44:59.513 --> 00:45:01.448
Will I become
Lady Greyjoy,

00:45:01.482 --> 00:45:04.552
- mistress of the Iron Islands?
- Don't be a fool.

00:45:04.586 --> 00:45:06.720
I hear Jaime Lannister
attacked Lord Stark

00:45:06.755 --> 00:45:08.522
in the streets
of King's Landing.

00:45:08.557 --> 00:45:12.426
Every man for a hundred miles will be
marching off to war soon

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.427
and most of them
will never come back.

00:45:14.462 --> 00:45:16.463
There's nothing left
for me here.

00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:19.799
Let's go, Stefon.

00:45:19.833 --> 00:45:21.300
Giddyup.

00:45:21.334 --> 00:45:23.602
Let me see it
one more time!

00:45:23.636 --> 00:45:25.937
See what?

00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:39.450
I'm going to miss you.

00:45:39.485 --> 00:45:41.352
I know.

00:45:55.132 --> 00:45:57.167
I'm sending you both
back to Winterfell.

00:45:57.201 --> 00:45:58.601
- What?!
- Listen--

00:45:58.635 --> 00:46:01.237
- What about Joffrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?

00:46:01.271 --> 00:46:02.550
Is that why
you're sending us home?

00:46:02.575 --> 00:46:03.739
What? No.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.174
Please, father.
Please don't.

00:46:05.208 --> 00:46:07.376
You can't.
I've got my lessons with Syrio.

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.011
I'm finally
getting good.

00:46:09.045 --> 00:46:11.480
This isn't
a punishment.

00:46:11.514 --> 00:46:13.916
I want you back in Winterfell
for your own safety.

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:15.384
Can we take Syrio
back with us?

00:46:15.419 --> 00:46:16.990
Who cares about your
stupid dancing teacher?

00:46:17.015 --> 00:46:18.315
I can't go.

00:46:18.322 --> 00:46:20.190
I'm supposed to marry
Prince Joffrey.

00:46:20.224 --> 00:46:22.126
I love him and I'm meant
to be his Queen

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.762
- and have his babies.
- Seven hells.

00:46:24.796 --> 00:46:26.430
When you're old enough,

00:46:26.464 --> 00:46:29.166
I'll make you a match
with someone who's worthy of you,

00:46:29.201 --> 00:46:31.869
someone who's brave
and gentle and strong--

00:46:31.903 --> 00:46:35.173
I don't want someone brave
and gentle and strong. I want him!

00:46:35.207 --> 00:46:37.976
He'll be the greatest
King that ever was, a golden lion,

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.778
and I'll give him
sons with beautiful blond hair.

00:46:40.813 --> 00:46:43.448
The lion' not
his Sigil, idiot.

00:46:43.482 --> 00:46:45.283
He's a stag,
like his father.

00:46:45.317 --> 00:46:48.219
He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk King.

00:46:51.423 --> 00:46:54.259
Go on, girls. Get your Septa and start
packing your things.

00:46:54.293 --> 00:46:55.795
- Wait!
- Come on.

00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:57.463
But it's not fair!

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.903
"Lord Orys Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.809
"Axel Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:47:40.911 --> 00:47:43.713
"Lyonel Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:47:45.083 --> 00:47:47.851
"Steffon Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.891
"Robert Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:47:57.894 --> 00:48:00.095
"Joffrey Baratheon...

00:48:01.163 --> 00:48:03.264
Golden-haired."

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:36.732
Daenerys!

00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:41.003
Where's my sister?

00:48:41.038 --> 00:48:42.205
Stop him.

00:48:42.239 --> 00:48:43.773
Where is she?

00:48:43.808 --> 00:48:45.942
Hmm?

00:48:48.412 --> 00:48:51.180
Where is she?
I'm here for the feast.

00:48:52.249 --> 00:48:54.517
- The whore's feast?
- Come.

00:48:54.551 --> 00:48:56.218
Get your hands off me!

00:48:56.252 --> 00:48:58.787
No one touches
the Dragon!

00:48:59.655 --> 00:49:01.823
Khal rhae mhar!

00:49:01.857 --> 00:49:04.625
Me ifa!

00:49:07.263 --> 00:49:09.731
Khal Drogo!

00:49:09.766 --> 00:49:12.234
I'm here for the feast.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:17.040
Nevakhi vekha ha maan.

00:49:17.074 --> 00:49:19.442
Khal Drogo says
there is a place for you.

00:49:19.477 --> 00:49:21.678
Back there.

00:49:23.915 --> 00:49:26.150
That is no place
for a King.

00:49:26.184 --> 00:49:28.852
You are no King.

00:49:31.088 --> 00:49:33.255
Keep away from me!

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:35.291
Viserys, please.

00:49:37.427 --> 00:49:39.328
There she is.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.534
Put the sword down.
They'll kill us all.

00:49:46.569 --> 00:49:49.204
They can't kill us.

00:49:50.539 --> 00:49:53.241
They can't shed blood
in their sacred city.

00:50:00.317 --> 00:50:01.751
But I can.

00:50:11.495 --> 00:50:13.930
I want what I came for.

00:50:13.964 --> 00:50:16.366
I want the crown
he promised me.

00:50:17.234 --> 00:50:19.135
He bought you.

00:50:19.169 --> 00:50:21.303
But he never
paid for you.

00:50:26.509 --> 00:50:29.578
Tell him I want what was bargained
for or I'm taking you back.

00:50:30.647 --> 00:50:33.249
He can keep the baby.

00:50:33.283 --> 00:50:35.584
I'll cut it out
and leave it for him.

00:50:38.822 --> 00:50:42.058
Anha vazhak maan
rek me zala.

00:50:43.494 --> 00:50:46.830
Anha vazhak maan
firikhnharen hoshora

00:50:46.864 --> 00:50:49.599
ma mahrazhi aqovi
affin mori atihi mae!

00:50:49.633 --> 00:50:52.068
What's he saying?

00:50:53.503 --> 00:50:55.237
He says yes.

00:50:56.673 --> 00:50:59.574
You shall have
a golden crown...

00:51:01.211 --> 00:51:03.779
That men shall tremble
to behold.

00:51:14.924 --> 00:51:17.125
That was all I wanted.

00:51:19.494 --> 00:51:21.629
What-what was promised.

00:51:38.113 --> 00:51:40.080
Qora mae.

00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:43.383
No!

00:51:43.418 --> 00:51:46.120
No!
You cannot touch me.

00:51:46.154 --> 00:51:48.489
I am the Dragon.
I am the Dragon!

00:51:48.523 --> 00:51:51.292
I want my crown!
Ahh!

00:51:51.327 --> 00:51:54.496
Ammeni haz jolin!

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.842
- Look away, Khaleesi.
- No.

00:52:12.816 --> 00:52:15.184
No, Dany.

00:52:15.218 --> 00:52:16.685
Dany, tell them.

00:52:16.719 --> 00:52:18.153
Make them!

00:52:19.155 --> 00:52:21.924
Dany, make them...

00:52:23.593 --> 00:52:25.694
No, you can't!

00:52:25.728 --> 00:52:28.864
Just-- please!

00:52:28.898 --> 00:52:31.833
Dany, please!

00:52:33.436 --> 00:52:35.938
A crown for a King.

00:52:50.921 --> 00:52:53.289
Khaleesi?

00:52:53.323 --> 00:52:55.525
He was no Dragon.

00:52:56.694 --> 00:52:59.330
Fire cannot kill a Dragon.
