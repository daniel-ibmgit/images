WEBVTT

00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:02.641
I'm giving you half
of our forces.

00:00:02.643 --> 00:00:05.317
You will bring them
to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home

00:00:05.351 --> 00:00:09.260
and remind her that
Lannisters pay their debts.

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:11.500
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:14.205
- No more than I love mine.
- And they're all Jaime's.

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.242
Jaime and I are more than brother
and sister. We belong together.

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:20.210
When the King returns from his
hunt, I'll tell him the truth.

00:00:20.244 --> 00:00:21.911
You must
be gone by then.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.613
There's no rider.

00:00:24.647 --> 00:00:27.516
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
Where's my Uncle?

00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:30.485
- What's he got there?
- To me, Ghost.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.820
Gods be good!

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:35.323
Ned!
It's Robert.

00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:36.893
We were hunting a boar.

00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:40.465
Give it to the Council
after I'm dead.

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:43.372
He named you Protector of the Realm.
She won't care.

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:45.409
Give me an hour and I can put
100 swords at your command.

00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:48.245
Every moment you delay gives
Cersei another moment to prepare.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.782
I will not dishonor Robert's last
hours by shedding blood in his halls.

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:53.952
King Robert
still wants me dead.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.555
This poisoner was the first,
he won't be the last.

00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:11.775
King Joffrey and the Queen Regent
request your presence in the throne room.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.311
- King Joffrey?
- King Robert is gone.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:17.613
Bend the knee and swear
loyalty to my son.

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:19.615
Your son has no claim
to the throne.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.683
Kill him!
Kill all of them, I command it!

00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:29.524
I did warn you
not to trust me.

00:01:39.294 --> 00:01:43.294

00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:29.160
Yah!
Left high, left low.

00:03:46.746 --> 00:03:48.814
Right low,
lunge right.

00:03:51.984 --> 00:03:54.685
You break anything,
the Septa will have my head.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.520
What is--

00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:10.365
Your sister knew perfectly
well we were to leave today.

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:12.567
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.

00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:15.303
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:17.873
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:19.808
Hush!

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.044
Go back to your room.

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.381
Bar the doors

00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:26.616
and do not open them for anyone
you do not know.

00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:29.319
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

00:04:29.354 --> 00:04:31.155
Run!

00:04:34.893 --> 00:04:36.560
This way!

00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:52.240
Left, right.
Rah!

00:04:52.274 --> 00:04:53.975
Now you are dead.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.977
You said right,

00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:57.879
but you went left.

00:04:57.913 --> 00:05:00.114
And now you are
a dead girl.

00:05:00.148 --> 00:05:01.749
Only 'cause you lied.

00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:04.418
My tongue lied.
My eyes

00:05:04.452 --> 00:05:07.655
shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:10.191
I was so.
I watched, but you--

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:13.695
Watching is not seeing,
dead girl.

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:19.401
The seeing,
the true seeing,

00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:21.871
that is the heart
of swordplay.

00:05:26.377 --> 00:05:28.879
Arya Stark,
come with us.

00:05:28.913 --> 00:05:31.649
Your father wants
to see you.

00:05:31.683 --> 00:05:34.051
And why is it

00:05:34.085 --> 00:05:36.520
that Lord Eddard is
sending Lannister men

00:05:36.554 --> 00:05:38.756
in place of his own?
I am wondering.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.859
Mind your place,
dancing master.

00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:44.428
This is no
concern of yours.

00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:46.297
My father wouldn't
send you.

00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:52.536
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.905
Take her.

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:58.909
Are you men or snakes, that you
would threaten a child?

00:05:58.943 --> 00:06:01.078
Get out of my way,
little man.

00:06:01.112 --> 00:06:04.581
I am Syrio Forel...

00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:06.616
Foreign bastard.

00:06:09.353 --> 00:06:13.056
...And you will be speaking
to me with more respect.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.692
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:19.964
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

00:06:19.998 --> 00:06:22.633
Run to your father.

00:06:43.122 --> 00:06:45.857
Bloody oafs.

00:06:45.892 --> 00:06:47.759
Be gone now, Arya.

00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:50.363
Come with me.
Run.

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:55.001
The First Sword of Braavos
does not run.

00:07:07.147 --> 00:07:09.048
What do we say

00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:11.017
to the God of Death?

00:07:11.051 --> 00:07:12.919
Not today.

00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:15.888
Go.

00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:43.548
Not today.
Not today.

00:07:53.092 --> 00:07:54.893
Stay away from me.

00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:56.594
I'll tell my father.

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:59.597
I'll-- I'll tell
the Queen.

00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:03.334
Who do you think sent me?

00:08:15.847 --> 00:08:17.715
Needle.

00:08:20.953 --> 00:08:22.987
There she is.

00:08:23.022 --> 00:08:25.289
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

00:08:25.324 --> 00:08:27.025
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

00:08:27.059 --> 00:08:29.126
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.

00:08:29.161 --> 00:08:30.728
She'll reward me--
the Queen!

00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:32.930
Stay away!

00:09:02.028 --> 00:09:05.664
Lord Stark,
you must be thirsty.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.268
Varys.

00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:13.372
I promise you
it isn't poisoned.

00:09:15.042 --> 00:09:17.344
Why is it no one ever
trusts the eunuch?

00:09:25.887 --> 00:09:27.655
Not so much, My Lord.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.724
I would save the rest,
if I were you.

00:09:29.758 --> 00:09:33.628
Hide it. Men have been known to die
of thirst in these cells.

00:09:35.498 --> 00:09:38.000
What about
my daughters?

00:09:38.034 --> 00:09:40.569
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

00:09:40.604 --> 00:09:42.805
Even my little birds
cannot find her.

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:46.375
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

00:09:46.409 --> 00:09:49.979
Cersei will keep her close. The rest
of your household though--

00:09:50.013 --> 00:09:52.181
all dead,
it grieves me to say.

00:09:52.215 --> 00:09:54.483
I do so hate
the sight of blood.

00:09:55.985 --> 00:09:58.854
You watched my men being
slaughtered and did nothing.

00:09:58.888 --> 00:10:01.190
And would again, My Lord.

00:10:01.224 --> 00:10:05.627
I was unarmed, unarmored and
surrounded by Lannister swords.

00:10:05.662 --> 00:10:07.996
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

00:10:13.936 --> 00:10:16.304
What madness led you
to tell the Queen

00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:19.141
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:23.478
The madness of mercy.

00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:27.916
That she might
save her children.

00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:29.784
Ah, the children.

00:10:29.819 --> 00:10:32.688
It is always
the innocents who suffer.

00:10:32.722 --> 00:10:35.623
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert,
nor the boar.

00:10:35.658 --> 00:10:39.127
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:42.396
but it was your mercy
that killed the King.

00:10:45.967 --> 00:10:49.336
I trust you know you are
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

00:10:54.074 --> 00:10:56.642
The Queen
can't kill me.

00:10:56.677 --> 00:10:59.145
Cat holds her brother.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.881
The wrong brother
sadly.

00:11:01.916 --> 00:11:03.650
And lost to her.

00:11:03.684 --> 00:11:06.619
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:12.893
If that's true,

00:11:12.927 --> 00:11:16.463
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

00:11:16.497 --> 00:11:19.066
Not today, My Lord.

00:11:22.104 --> 00:11:24.939
Tell me something, Varys.

00:11:24.974 --> 00:11:27.476
Who do you truly serve?

00:11:28.712 --> 00:11:31.380
The Realm, My Lord.

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:33.682
Someone must.

00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:55.403
It's Othor,
without a doubt.

00:11:56.739 --> 00:11:58.339
The other one is
Jafer Flowers, My Lord,

00:11:58.374 --> 00:12:01.142
less the hand
the wolf tore off.

00:12:01.177 --> 00:12:04.179
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

00:12:04.214 --> 00:12:07.082
Just these two,
My Lord.

00:12:07.117 --> 00:12:09.118
Been dead awhile,
I'd say.

00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:11.888
- Mmm.
- The smell.

00:12:15.294 --> 00:12:16.894
What smell?

00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:19.964
There is none.

00:12:19.998 --> 00:12:23.734
If they'd be dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

00:12:23.768 --> 00:12:26.470
We should burn them.

00:12:26.504 --> 00:12:29.540
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.

00:12:29.574 --> 00:12:31.742
The Wildling way.

00:12:31.777 --> 00:12:34.512
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:37.715
You may be
a coward, Tarly,

00:12:37.749 --> 00:12:39.884
but you're not stupid.

00:12:39.918 --> 00:12:43.954
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.458
Lord Commander,

00:12:47.492 --> 00:12:49.994
Maester Aemon awaits you
in his chambers--

00:12:50.028 --> 00:12:53.864
a raven
from King's Landing.

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:55.766
Come on,
move 'em out.

00:13:07.477 --> 00:13:10.344
Bring me a horn
of ale, Snow,

00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:13.314
and pour one
for yourself.

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:25.693
The King is dead.

00:13:37.805 --> 00:13:40.339
Is there any word
of my father?

00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:42.608
Sit.

00:13:47.113 --> 00:13:49.647
Lord Stark has been

00:13:49.681 --> 00:13:52.283
charged with treason.

00:13:52.317 --> 00:13:54.719
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

00:13:54.753 --> 00:13:57.489
to deny the throne
to Prince Joffrey.

00:14:09.838 --> 00:14:13.475
I hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:16.945
Your duty lies here now.

00:14:16.979 --> 00:14:20.048
My sisters were
in King's Landing too.

00:14:22.185 --> 00:14:24.486
I'm sure they'll be

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.321
treated gently.

00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:32.594
Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

00:14:32.628 --> 00:14:36.098
King Robert's body
was still warm

00:14:36.132 --> 00:14:40.402
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

00:14:40.437 --> 00:14:42.805
He wouldn't do that.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.708
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.

00:14:45.743 --> 00:14:48.845
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:52.516
Send for my father. He'll tell you--
the King was his friend.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.619
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of
any wrong. We know that.

00:14:55.653 --> 00:14:59.155
Yet you are the daughter
of a traitor.

00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:01.357
How can I allow you
to marry my son?

00:15:01.392 --> 00:15:04.560
A child born
of a traitor's seed

00:15:04.594 --> 00:15:06.928
is no fit consort
for our King.

00:15:06.963 --> 00:15:09.597
She is a sweet thing now,
Your Grace,

00:15:09.631 --> 00:15:12.099
but in 10 years who knows

00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:14.101
what treasons
she may hatch?

00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:17.204
No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife
to him, you'll see.

00:15:17.238 --> 00:15:21.809
I'll be a Queen just like you,
I promise. I won't hatch anything.

00:15:23.312 --> 00:15:25.813
The girl is innocent,
Your Grace.

00:15:25.848 --> 00:15:29.650
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.860
Little dove, you must
write to Lady Catelyn

00:15:38.895 --> 00:15:41.229
and your brother,
the eldest, what's his name?

00:15:41.264 --> 00:15:42.998
Robb.

00:15:43.032 --> 00:15:45.801
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

00:15:45.836 --> 00:15:48.237
Best it comes from you.

00:15:48.272 --> 00:15:50.640
If you would help
your father,

00:15:50.674 --> 00:15:53.110
urge your brother
to keep the King's peace.

00:15:53.144 --> 00:15:57.047
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:06.689
If-- if I could see my father,
talk to him about--

00:16:09.292 --> 00:16:12.661
You disappoint me, child.

00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:14.996
We have told you
of your father's treason.

00:16:15.031 --> 00:16:17.198
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

00:16:17.233 --> 00:16:19.500
I only meant that--

00:16:21.704 --> 00:16:23.538
what will happen to him?

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.942
- That depends.
- On-- on what?

00:16:28.976 --> 00:16:30.844
On your brother.

00:16:33.881 --> 00:16:36.216
And on you.

00:16:43.959 --> 00:16:46.728
Treason?

00:16:46.762 --> 00:16:48.897
Sansa wrote this?

00:16:48.931 --> 00:16:51.300
It is your sister's hand,
but the Queen's words.

00:16:51.334 --> 00:16:55.437
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new King.

00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:58.574
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his ass kissed?

00:16:58.608 --> 00:17:02.111
This is a royal
command, My Lord.

00:17:02.145 --> 00:17:05.614
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.

00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:08.417
His Grace summons me
to King's Landing,

00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:10.886
I'll go to King's Landing.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.655
But not alone.

00:17:15.758 --> 00:17:17.492
Call the banners.

00:17:19.194 --> 00:17:20.861
All of them, My Lord?

00:17:20.896 --> 00:17:22.767
They've all sworn to defend
my father, have they not?

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:23.992
They have.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.168
Now we see what
their words are worth.

00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:30.438
Yeah.

00:17:38.681 --> 00:17:41.082
Are you afraid?

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.620
I must be.

00:17:45.655 --> 00:17:47.823
Good.

00:17:47.857 --> 00:17:49.891
Why is that good?

00:17:49.926 --> 00:17:52.227
It means
you're not stupid.

00:18:15.618 --> 00:18:17.519
You've had this
since dawn?

00:18:18.554 --> 00:18:21.122
He sent it to me,
not you.

00:18:21.157 --> 00:18:23.591
I've only shown it
to you as a courtesy.

00:18:23.626 --> 00:18:25.493
A courtesy?!

00:18:25.527 --> 00:18:27.529
My husband has been
taken prisoner.

00:18:27.563 --> 00:18:29.197
My son intends
to declare war.

00:18:29.232 --> 00:18:31.099
A war?

00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:33.535
Your son against
the Lannisters?

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.939
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

00:18:37.973 --> 00:18:41.142
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

00:18:41.177 --> 00:18:43.879
He is your brother by law!

00:18:43.913 --> 00:18:46.782
Does family mean
nothing to you?

00:18:46.816 --> 00:18:49.685
Family means
everything to me.

00:18:49.719 --> 00:18:52.154
And I will not
risk Robin's life

00:18:52.188 --> 00:18:54.657
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:57.593
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

00:18:57.627 --> 00:18:59.828
You just ate.

00:18:59.863 --> 00:19:02.698
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?

00:19:02.732 --> 00:19:06.568
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:10.906
You're always
welcome here, sister.

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.942
But if you're asking me to send men
from the Vale to fight--

00:19:13.977 --> 00:19:16.178
That is what I ask.

00:19:18.147 --> 00:19:21.016
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.652
I'll feed you after.

00:19:28.925 --> 00:19:31.327
If you fear for the safety
of your son--

00:19:31.361 --> 00:19:34.029
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

00:19:34.063 --> 00:19:36.565
Are you an idiot?

00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:39.001
They killed my husband.

00:19:39.035 --> 00:19:41.470
You say they shoved
your boy from a window.

00:19:41.504 --> 00:19:44.039
These people
will do anything.

00:19:44.073 --> 00:19:46.140
And that is why
we have to stop them.

00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:52.713
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

00:19:52.747 --> 00:19:56.483
where they belong,
to protect their Lord.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.302
Will you shut up?

00:20:15.406 --> 00:20:17.440
There's hill tribes
all around here.

00:20:17.475 --> 00:20:19.943
If I'm going to die,

00:20:19.977 --> 00:20:22.312
it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:25.583
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

00:20:25.617 --> 00:20:28.886
Eh? What would
you do then?

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.756
Starve, most likely.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.624
You don't think
I'd do it, do you?

00:20:35.127 --> 00:20:38.162
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

00:20:38.197 --> 00:20:41.099
Golden women?

00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:43.335
Stick with me
and you'll have them all,

00:20:43.369 --> 00:20:46.203
for as long as I'm around
and not for a moment longer.

00:20:46.238 --> 00:20:49.506
But you knew that.

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:53.109
That is why you so valiantly took
up arms to defend my honor.

00:20:54.979 --> 00:20:57.314
Fair enough.

00:20:57.349 --> 00:20:59.884
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

00:20:59.918 --> 00:21:02.487
and "My Lord" you
every time you take a shit.

00:21:02.521 --> 00:21:05.790
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

00:21:06.926 --> 00:21:09.028
Though I would treasure
your friendship,

00:21:09.062 --> 00:21:11.664
I'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

00:21:11.699 --> 00:21:15.102
And if the day ever comes when
you're tempted to sell me out,

00:21:15.136 --> 00:21:16.870
remember this:

00:21:16.905 --> 00:21:19.773
Whatever their price,
I'll beat it.

00:21:19.807 --> 00:21:21.908
I like living.

00:21:26.514 --> 00:21:30.350
Tyrion.

00:21:31.953 --> 00:21:33.186
Tyrion.

00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:39.226
Tyrion.

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:03.618
Come, share our fire.

00:22:03.652 --> 00:22:06.420
Help yourselves
to our goat.

00:22:12.861 --> 00:22:15.695
When you meet your Gods,
you tell them

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.664
Shagga Son of Dolf

00:22:17.698 --> 00:22:21.067
of the Stone Crows
sent you.

00:22:21.102 --> 00:22:24.505
I am Tyrion son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:27.574
How would you like to die,
Tyrion son of Tywin?

00:22:29.277 --> 00:22:31.745
In my own bed,
at the age of 80

00:22:31.779 --> 00:22:34.647
with a bellyful of wine and
a girl's mouth around my cock.

00:22:40.854 --> 00:22:43.056
Take the half man.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.858
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

00:22:45.893 --> 00:22:47.994
No no no no no!

00:22:48.028 --> 00:22:51.097
My-- my House is rich
and powerful.

00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:53.799
If you see us
through these mountains,

00:22:53.834 --> 00:22:55.802
my father will
shower you with gold.

00:22:55.836 --> 00:22:57.871
We have no use
for a half man's promises.

00:22:57.905 --> 00:23:02.476
Half a man maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.111
What do the Stone Crows do?

00:23:04.145 --> 00:23:06.380
Hide behind rocks
and shiver

00:23:06.414 --> 00:23:09.383
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

00:23:09.417 --> 00:23:12.052
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

00:23:13.355 --> 00:23:15.289
Good enough
for killing sheep,

00:23:15.323 --> 00:23:17.057
if the sheep
don't fight back.

00:23:17.092 --> 00:23:19.293
Lannister smiths
shit better steel.

00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:28.368
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

00:23:39.247 --> 00:23:42.650
That trinket is worth more than
everything your tribe owns.

00:23:44.554 --> 00:23:47.924
But if you help us,
Shagga Son of Dolf,

00:23:47.958 --> 00:23:50.627
I will not give you trinkets.

00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:53.130
I will give you this.

00:23:54.032 --> 00:23:55.633
What is "this"?

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:59.336
The Vale of Arryn.

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:02.673
The Lords of the Vale have always
spat upon the hill tribes.

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:06.911
The Lords of the Vale
want me dead.

00:24:08.613 --> 00:24:11.715
I believe it is time
for new Lords of the Vale.

00:24:19.156 --> 00:24:21.457
Ser Alliser:
Now there's a rare sight--

00:24:21.492 --> 00:24:24.994
not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

00:24:35.939 --> 00:24:38.741
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

00:24:42.011 --> 00:24:44.079
Blood will always tell.

00:24:44.113 --> 00:24:47.250
You'll hang
for this, bastard.

00:25:06.536 --> 00:25:09.770
I told you not to do
anything stupid.

00:25:09.805 --> 00:25:13.440
You're confined
to quarters. Go.

00:25:38.201 --> 00:25:40.135
Ghost, what's wrong?

00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:43.373
Is something out there?

00:26:15.238 --> 00:26:17.506
Commander?

00:26:20.744 --> 00:26:23.546
Stay.

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:37.094
Hello?

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:47.038
Who's there?

00:26:53.846 --> 00:26:56.781
Lord Commander?

00:27:23.277 --> 00:27:25.111
Snow?

00:27:25.146 --> 00:27:26.746
Commander!

00:27:41.028 --> 00:27:42.661
Move move!

00:28:01.281 --> 00:28:03.749
What did they do?

00:28:19.835 --> 00:28:23.204
I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

00:28:23.238 --> 00:28:27.141
Gold to hire ships,
Princess,

00:28:27.175 --> 00:28:30.011
ships to sail
to Westeros.

00:28:45.794 --> 00:28:48.262
Jorah, make them stop.

00:28:48.296 --> 00:28:50.530
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

00:28:50.565 --> 00:28:54.067
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

00:29:04.914 --> 00:29:07.282
Princess, you have
a gentle heart,

00:29:07.316 --> 00:29:09.318
but this is how
it's always been.

00:29:09.352 --> 00:29:12.321
I do not have
a gentle heart, Ser.

00:29:24.734 --> 00:29:27.235
Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!

00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:31.405
- Come.
- Man: Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!

00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:38.512
What do you want
done with them?

00:29:38.547 --> 00:29:41.114
Bring her to me.
And those women there.

00:29:42.984 --> 00:29:45.418
You cannot claim
them all, Princess.

00:29:45.452 --> 00:29:47.487
I can,

00:29:47.521 --> 00:29:50.223
and I will.

00:29:50.258 --> 00:29:52.225
Me Fati!

00:29:52.259 --> 00:29:55.729
Khaleesi vazha
anhaan qorasokh anni,

00:29:55.763 --> 00:29:58.098
ch'anha afichak
mae m'arakhoon anni!

00:29:58.132 --> 00:30:00.968
Me vastoe hatif anni;

00:30:01.002 --> 00:30:03.704
ahhazaan
yer Nemo vacchaki.

00:31:29.757 --> 00:31:32.659
Ohos.

00:31:33.961 --> 00:31:35.828
Ohos.

00:33:03.445 --> 00:33:05.580
Thank you,
silver lady.

00:33:07.817 --> 00:33:10.284
Who are you?

00:33:10.319 --> 00:33:13.254
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.

00:33:14.923 --> 00:33:17.659
My mother was Godswife
here before me.

00:33:17.693 --> 00:33:20.128
She taught me how to make
healing smokes and ointments.

00:33:20.162 --> 00:33:23.165
All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.301
The Great Shepherd sent me
to Earth to heal his--

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:32.943
lamb or lion,

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:35.646
his wound must be
washed and sewn

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.947
or it will fester.

00:34:06.542 --> 00:34:09.845
For 30 years
I've been making corpses

00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:11.713
out of men, boy.

00:34:11.748 --> 00:34:14.482
I'm the man you want
leading the Vanguard.

00:34:15.851 --> 00:34:18.018
Galbart Glover
will lead the Van.

00:34:18.053 --> 00:34:20.720
The bloody Wall will melt

00:34:20.755 --> 00:34:23.823
before an Umber marches
behind a Glover.

00:34:24.658 --> 00:34:26.893
I will lead the Van

00:34:26.927 --> 00:34:29.228
or I will take my men

00:34:29.262 --> 00:34:31.363
and march them home.

00:34:36.302 --> 00:34:38.971
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

00:34:39.006 --> 00:34:42.075
And when I am done
with the Lannisters

00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:44.410
I will march back North,

00:34:44.445 --> 00:34:45.912
root you out of your Keep

00:34:45.946 --> 00:34:48.616
and hang you
for an oathbreaker.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:50.651
Oathbreaker, is it?!

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:54.789
I'll not sit here
and swallow insults

00:34:54.823 --> 00:34:57.358
from a boy so green
he pisses grass.

00:35:11.539 --> 00:35:13.840
My Lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

00:35:13.874 --> 00:35:15.942
against your Liege Lord.

00:35:15.976 --> 00:35:20.280
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant
to cut my meat for me.

00:35:22.317 --> 00:35:24.752
Your meat...

00:35:29.892 --> 00:35:32.561
is bloody tough.

00:36:03.195 --> 00:36:06.164
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

00:36:10.637 --> 00:36:14.206
- Where are you going?
- South. For father.

00:36:14.241 --> 00:36:15.942
But it's the middle
of the night.

00:36:15.976 --> 00:36:18.110
The Lannisters have
spies everywhere.

00:36:18.145 --> 00:36:20.712
I don't want them
to know we're coming.

00:36:20.747 --> 00:36:23.449
They have
more men than we do.

00:36:23.483 --> 00:36:25.684
Aye, they do.

00:36:25.719 --> 00:36:27.786
Can't I come with you?

00:36:27.821 --> 00:36:30.322
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.

00:36:30.356 --> 00:36:32.458
And I won't get
in the way, I--

00:36:32.492 --> 00:36:35.027
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

00:36:35.061 --> 00:36:37.196
Until I return
that will be you.

00:36:39.666 --> 00:36:42.935
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

00:36:45.573 --> 00:36:48.942
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

00:36:48.977 --> 00:36:51.112
I will.

00:36:51.146 --> 00:36:53.214
I'll send letters
whenever I can,

00:36:53.248 --> 00:36:55.484
but if you don't
hear from me,

00:36:55.518 --> 00:36:57.419
don't be scared.

00:37:02.526 --> 00:37:04.727
Until I return.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:28.018
How long have you been
hiding out there?

00:37:28.053 --> 00:37:31.522
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

00:37:32.858 --> 00:37:34.792
They've all gone away.

00:37:34.827 --> 00:37:37.762
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father

00:37:37.796 --> 00:37:39.998
and they'll come back
with mother.

00:37:41.667 --> 00:37:44.169
No, they won't.

00:37:48.842 --> 00:37:50.943
Please watch
over Robb.

00:37:50.977 --> 00:37:53.445
And watch over all the
other men from Winterfell.

00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:56.648
And Theon too,
I suppose.

00:38:02.355 --> 00:38:05.123
You hear them, boy?

00:38:05.158 --> 00:38:07.759
The Old Gods are
answering you.

00:38:07.793 --> 00:38:09.694
What are you
doing here?

00:38:09.728 --> 00:38:12.597
They're my Gods too.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.703
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only Gods.

00:38:19.072 --> 00:38:21.374
Even slaves
are allowed to pray.

00:38:21.408 --> 00:38:23.776
You're not a slave.

00:38:25.846 --> 00:38:28.815
Well, your friend did
put a knife to my throat.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.552
I'm not complaining,
Little Lord,

00:38:32.586 --> 00:38:35.321
just telling truths.

00:38:36.623 --> 00:38:39.425
What did you mean
about hearing the Gods?

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.794
You asked them,

00:38:41.828 --> 00:38:43.462
they're answering you.

00:38:43.497 --> 00:38:46.466
Shh.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.167
Open your ears.

00:38:53.607 --> 00:38:55.841
It's only the wind.

00:38:55.876 --> 00:38:58.878
Who do you think
sends the wind

00:38:58.912 --> 00:39:00.880
if not the Gods?

00:39:00.915 --> 00:39:02.616
They see you, boy.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.052
They hear you.

00:39:06.688 --> 00:39:09.524
Your brother will get no help
from them where he's going.

00:39:09.558 --> 00:39:12.360
The Old Gods have
no power in the South.

00:39:12.395 --> 00:39:16.064
The Weirwoods there were
all cut down a long time ago.

00:39:16.099 --> 00:39:18.868
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

00:39:21.905 --> 00:39:25.774
Well, there's a big man.

00:39:25.808 --> 00:39:28.977
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the Queen.

00:39:29.011 --> 00:39:31.379
Go back and find
your clothes, Hodor.

00:39:31.413 --> 00:39:33.247
Go dress.

00:39:33.282 --> 00:39:34.815
Hodor.

00:39:37.953 --> 00:39:40.154
Are there really giants
beyond the Wall?

00:39:41.523 --> 00:39:44.492
Giants
and worse than giants.

00:39:44.526 --> 00:39:47.495
I tried telling
your brother,

00:39:47.529 --> 00:39:49.330
he's marching
the wrong way.

00:39:49.364 --> 00:39:52.867
All these swords,
they should be going North, boy.

00:39:52.901 --> 00:39:55.069
North, not south!

00:39:57.807 --> 00:40:00.208
The cold winds are rising.

00:40:16.193 --> 00:40:18.528
They were touched
by White Walkers.

00:40:20.064 --> 00:40:22.032
That's why
they came back.

00:40:22.066 --> 00:40:24.935
That's why their eyes
turned blue.

00:40:24.969 --> 00:40:28.104
Only fire will
stop them.

00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:31.808
How do you know that?

00:40:31.843 --> 00:40:33.577
I read about it
in a book--

00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:36.680
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

00:40:39.217 --> 00:40:41.351
What else
did the book say?

00:40:41.386 --> 00:40:43.286
The White Walkers

00:40:43.321 --> 00:40:46.089
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

00:40:46.123 --> 00:40:48.659
And when they wake up--

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.497
And when they
wake up, what?

00:40:56.467 --> 00:40:58.969
I hope The Wall
is high enough.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.801
Summer snows, My Lady.

00:41:33.836 --> 00:41:36.871
Robb's brought
the North with him.

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:44.946
The River Lords
are falling back

00:41:44.981 --> 00:41:46.815
with Jaime Lannister
at their heels.

00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:50.252
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a
second Lannister army from the South.

00:41:50.287 --> 00:41:53.056
Our scouts confirm it's even larger
than the Kingslayer's.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.360
One army or two,
the Kings in the North

00:41:56.394 --> 00:42:00.197
threw back hosts
10 times as large.

00:42:03.701 --> 00:42:05.368
Mother!

00:42:08.773 --> 00:42:11.006
You look well.

00:42:12.509 --> 00:42:16.278
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome
sight in these troubled times.

00:42:16.312 --> 00:42:18.781
We had not thought
to meet you here, My Lady.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.318
I had not thought
to be here.

00:42:22.352 --> 00:42:24.420
I would speak
with my son alone.

00:42:24.454 --> 00:42:26.756
I know you will
forgive me, My Lords.

00:42:26.791 --> 00:42:29.025
You heard her!
Move your asses!

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.395
Come on, out.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.065
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:36.001
Have no fear, My Lady.

00:42:36.035 --> 00:42:38.803
We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole

00:42:38.837 --> 00:42:41.606
and then it's on to the Red Keep
to free Ned.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.574
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

00:42:44.609 --> 00:42:46.943
You're not
wasting away, are you?

00:42:58.188 --> 00:43:01.023
I remember the day
you came into this world

00:43:01.058 --> 00:43:04.093
red-faced and squalling.

00:43:05.595 --> 00:43:08.264
And now I find you
leading a host to war.

00:43:09.299 --> 00:43:11.701
- There was no one else.
- No one?

00:43:11.735 --> 00:43:14.470
Who were those men
I saw here?

00:43:14.505 --> 00:43:17.574
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

00:43:17.608 --> 00:43:20.644
If you think you can send me back
to Winterfell--

00:43:20.678 --> 00:43:22.946
Oh, would that I could.

00:43:26.017 --> 00:43:27.985
There was...

00:43:28.019 --> 00:43:30.454
a letter.

00:43:32.891 --> 00:43:34.326
From Sansa.

00:43:35.294 --> 00:43:37.595
From the Queen,
you mean.

00:43:45.569 --> 00:43:48.671
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

00:43:59.282 --> 00:44:01.616
How many men
do you have?

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:04.052
18,000.

00:44:04.086 --> 00:44:06.554
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey--

00:44:06.588 --> 00:44:09.657
you would never
be allowed to leave. No.

00:44:09.691 --> 00:44:12.460
Our best hope--
our only hope--

00:44:12.494 --> 00:44:15.797
is that you can defeat
them in the field.

00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:17.865
And if I lose?

00:44:17.899 --> 00:44:20.434
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

00:44:20.469 --> 00:44:23.472
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

00:44:23.506 --> 00:44:26.208
On the orders
of Tywin Lannister.

00:44:26.242 --> 00:44:28.945
And the years have
not made him kinder.

00:44:32.049 --> 00:44:34.218
If you lose,

00:44:34.252 --> 00:44:36.954
your father dies,

00:44:36.988 --> 00:44:38.522
your sisters die,

00:44:38.556 --> 00:44:40.790
we die.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.394
Well, that makes it
simple then.

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:48.730
I suppose it does.

00:45:11.752 --> 00:45:14.987
From here it might be best if
Bronn and I continue alone.

00:45:15.022 --> 00:45:17.591
Best for Tyrion
son of Tywin.

00:45:17.625 --> 00:45:19.626
Not best for me.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.830
If the half man betrays us,

00:45:22.864 --> 00:45:26.300
Shagga Son of Dolf
will cut off his manhood--

00:45:26.335 --> 00:45:28.870
and feed it
to the goats, yes.

00:45:31.374 --> 00:45:33.942
All right then.

00:45:33.976 --> 00:45:36.178
Time to meet my father.

00:46:08.511 --> 00:46:11.313
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

00:46:11.347 --> 00:46:13.215
Father.

00:46:14.718 --> 00:46:17.719
The rumors of your demise
were unfounded.

00:46:17.754 --> 00:46:21.155
Sorry
to disappoint you.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:23.725
And who are these...

00:46:23.759 --> 00:46:25.993
Companions of yours?

00:46:28.063 --> 00:46:30.496
This is Shagga
Son of Dolf,

00:46:30.531 --> 00:46:32.899
Chieftain
of the Stone Crows.

00:46:32.933 --> 00:46:37.303
Timett Son of Timett,
ruler of the Burned Men.

00:46:37.337 --> 00:46:42.075
This fair maid is
Chella daughter of Cheyk,

00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:44.478
leader
of the Black Ears.

00:46:44.512 --> 00:46:47.881
And here we have
Bronn son of...

00:46:47.916 --> 00:46:50.518
You wouldn't know him.

00:46:52.521 --> 00:46:55.090
May I present
My Lord Father,

00:46:55.124 --> 00:46:57.759
Tywin son of Tytos
of House Lannister,

00:46:57.794 --> 00:47:00.862
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?

00:47:02.832 --> 00:47:05.468
Kind of you
to go to war for me.

00:47:08.505 --> 00:47:10.439
You left us no choice.

00:47:10.474 --> 00:47:12.541
The honor of the House
was at stake.

00:47:14.044 --> 00:47:17.213
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

00:47:17.248 --> 00:47:19.782
We have our differences,
Jaime and I.

00:47:19.817 --> 00:47:21.985
He's braver.
I'm better looking.

00:47:22.019 --> 00:47:24.354
He's been covering himself
in glory.

00:47:24.389 --> 00:47:27.625
Jaime smashed the River Lords
at the Golden Tooth,

00:47:27.659 --> 00:47:31.328
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

00:47:31.362 --> 00:47:33.463
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?

00:47:33.497 --> 00:47:37.567
--Is our hostage. He will lead
no armies from his dungeon cell.

00:47:37.602 --> 00:47:39.636
How did my sweet sister
persuade the King

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.538
to imprison
his dear friend Ned?

00:47:41.573 --> 00:47:45.543
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

00:47:48.548 --> 00:47:50.516
My sister rules,
you mean.

00:47:51.718 --> 00:47:54.019
Stark's son has
called his banners.

00:47:54.054 --> 00:47:57.490
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

00:47:57.524 --> 00:47:59.291
One taste of battle
and he'll run

00:47:59.326 --> 00:48:01.895
back to Winterfell
with his tail between his legs.

00:48:03.097 --> 00:48:04.597
Maybe.

00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:07.200
Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

00:48:07.234 --> 00:48:09.736
You'd like him.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:13.807
While we're on
the subject of war,

00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:16.543
I made promises
to my friends here

00:48:16.577 --> 00:48:18.945
and a Lannister
always pays his debts.

00:48:18.979 --> 00:48:22.048
We shall require
3,000 helms and shields,

00:48:22.083 --> 00:48:24.317
plus swords, pikes,

00:48:24.351 --> 00:48:26.152
gorgets, maces--

00:48:26.186 --> 00:48:28.754
if it please My Lord,

00:48:28.788 --> 00:48:30.856
Ser Addam bids me report
that the Northmen

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:32.290
have crossed the Neck.

00:48:34.293 --> 00:48:36.761
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws.

00:48:36.795 --> 00:48:41.032
So be it. Kevan, command the
drummers beat assembly.

00:48:42.535 --> 00:48:45.671
And send word to Jaime that
I am moving against Robb Stark.

00:48:45.705 --> 00:48:47.673
At once, My Lord.

00:49:00.622 --> 00:49:03.590
It is said that the men of the
Mountain clans are great warriors.

00:49:03.625 --> 00:49:05.359
Ride with me
against my enemies

00:49:05.393 --> 00:49:08.429
and you shall have all
my son promised you and more.

00:49:08.464 --> 00:49:10.698
Only if the half man
fights with us.

00:49:10.733 --> 00:49:14.169
Until we hold the steel
he pledged us,

00:49:14.204 --> 00:49:16.605
the little lion's
life is ours.

00:49:22.178 --> 00:49:24.847
The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.

00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:26.715
We need to get him
on broken ground,

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:28.417
put his Knights
at a disadvantage.

00:49:28.451 --> 00:49:30.553
No, we need to get
around him

00:49:30.587 --> 00:49:33.489
and break Jaime Lannister's
siege of Riverrun.

00:49:33.524 --> 00:49:36.359
Do that and the River Lords
will join us.

00:49:36.393 --> 00:49:38.261
To do either we need to cross
the river

00:49:38.295 --> 00:49:39.962
and the only crossing
is at The Twins.

00:49:39.996 --> 00:49:42.031
Lord Frey controls
that bridge.

00:49:42.065 --> 00:49:43.632
Your father's bannerman.

00:49:43.666 --> 00:49:46.902
"The late Lord Frey"
my father calls him.

00:49:46.936 --> 00:49:50.439
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

00:49:50.473 --> 00:49:54.510
Some men takes their oaths
more seriously than others.

00:50:01.918 --> 00:50:04.653
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

00:50:04.687 --> 00:50:06.788
So what's it going to be?

00:50:06.823 --> 00:50:10.225
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

00:50:14.397 --> 00:50:15.931
Your pardon, my lords.

00:50:15.965 --> 00:50:18.634
We've captured
a Lannister scout.

00:50:20.537 --> 00:50:23.873
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
leaving this tent with his head.

00:50:25.209 --> 00:50:26.876
Where did you find him?

00:50:26.911 --> 00:50:29.045
In the brush above
the encampment.

00:50:29.079 --> 00:50:30.947
He looked to be counting.

00:50:41.392 --> 00:50:43.193
How high did you get?

00:50:45.563 --> 00:50:47.564
20,000.
Maybe more.

00:50:48.599 --> 00:50:50.333
You don't have
to do this yourself.

00:50:50.367 --> 00:50:51.934
Your father
would understand--

00:50:51.969 --> 00:50:56.005
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

00:50:57.407 --> 00:50:59.241
And he understands honor...

00:51:02.046 --> 00:51:04.313
and courage.

00:51:06.216 --> 00:51:08.050
Let him go.

00:51:09.019 --> 00:51:11.420
Robb.

00:51:23.432 --> 00:51:26.400
Tell Lord Tywin
Winter is coming for him.

00:51:26.434 --> 00:51:31.371
20,000 Northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:34.941
Yes, My Lord.

00:51:34.975 --> 00:51:36.777
Thank you, My Lord.

00:51:46.221 --> 00:51:49.923
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

00:51:49.958 --> 00:51:51.993
You call me boy again.

00:51:53.495 --> 00:51:55.129
Go on.

00:52:12.145 --> 00:52:15.347
Oi.

00:52:20.419 --> 00:52:23.088
It is also the wish
of His Grace

00:52:23.123 --> 00:52:28.428
that his loyal servant
Janos Slynt,

00:52:28.462 --> 00:52:31.565
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

00:52:31.599 --> 00:52:35.169
...Be at once raised
to the rank of Lord...

00:52:35.203 --> 00:52:40.674
- Lord Gyles.
- ...And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal,

00:52:40.708 --> 00:52:44.544
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honor

00:52:44.578 --> 00:52:49.682
after him
until the end of time.

00:52:53.519 --> 00:52:56.854
In the place of the traitor
Eddard Stark,

00:52:56.889 --> 00:53:01.559
it is the wish of His Grace
that Tywin Lannister,

00:53:01.593 --> 00:53:05.396
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,

00:53:05.431 --> 00:53:09.534
be appointed
Hand of the King.

00:53:09.568 --> 00:53:11.469
Lastly,

00:53:11.504 --> 00:53:14.338
in these times
of treason and turmoil,

00:53:14.372 --> 00:53:17.608
it is the view
of the Council

00:53:17.643 --> 00:53:20.177
that the life and safety

00:53:20.212 --> 00:53:22.880
of King Joffrey

00:53:22.914 --> 00:53:27.151
be of paramount importance.

00:53:28.754 --> 00:53:31.288
Ser Barristan Selmy.

00:53:37.629 --> 00:53:41.132
Your Grace, I am
yours to command.

00:53:41.166 --> 00:53:43.268
Rise, Ser Barristan.

00:53:44.137 --> 00:53:46.238
You may remove
your helm.

00:53:51.179 --> 00:53:53.781
You have served the Realm
long and faithfully.

00:53:53.815 --> 00:53:57.785
Every man and woman in the
Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:01.088
But it is time to put aside
your armor and your sword.

00:54:01.122 --> 00:54:04.025
It is time to rest
and look back with pride

00:54:04.059 --> 00:54:05.693
on your many years
of service.

00:54:07.897 --> 00:54:10.331
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

00:54:10.366 --> 00:54:12.533
Our vows are
taken for life.

00:54:12.568 --> 00:54:15.070
Only death relieves us
of our sacred trust.

00:54:15.104 --> 00:54:18.807
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?

00:54:18.841 --> 00:54:21.710
You let my father die.

00:54:21.744 --> 00:54:24.680
You're too old
to protect anybody.

00:54:26.984 --> 00:54:29.719
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined

00:54:29.753 --> 00:54:32.188
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

00:54:32.223 --> 00:54:34.491
as Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

00:54:34.525 --> 00:54:36.059
The man who
profaned his blade

00:54:36.094 --> 00:54:38.295
with the blood of the King
he had sworn to defend!

00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:40.263
Careful, Ser.

00:54:40.297 --> 00:54:41.998
We have nothing
but gratitude

00:54:42.032 --> 00:54:44.501
for your long service,
good Ser.

00:54:44.535 --> 00:54:47.003
You shall be given
a stout Keep beside the sea,

00:54:47.037 --> 00:54:49.372
with servants
to look after your every need.

00:54:49.406 --> 00:54:51.607
A hall to die in

00:54:51.642 --> 00:54:54.043
and men to bury me.

00:54:55.645 --> 00:54:58.681
I am a Knight.

00:54:58.715 --> 00:55:01.751
I shall die a Knight.

00:55:07.691 --> 00:55:09.826
A naked Knight,
apparently.

00:55:20.971 --> 00:55:24.407
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

00:55:28.579 --> 00:55:31.113
Here, boy!

00:55:31.148 --> 00:55:33.583
Melt it down and add it
to the others.

00:55:50.099 --> 00:55:52.434
If any man in this hall
has other matters

00:55:52.468 --> 00:55:55.603
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

00:55:55.638 --> 00:55:58.874
or go forth and hold
his silence.

00:56:01.545 --> 00:56:03.680
Your Grace.

00:56:03.714 --> 00:56:06.083
Come forward,
My Lady.

00:56:07.852 --> 00:56:10.588
The Lady Sansa
of House Stark.

00:56:12.124 --> 00:56:15.526
Do you have some business for
the King and the Council, Sansa?

00:56:15.561 --> 00:56:17.395
I do.

00:56:22.267 --> 00:56:25.369
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

00:56:25.403 --> 00:56:28.873
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

00:56:28.907 --> 00:56:31.775
Treason is a noxious weed.

00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:35.980
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.

00:56:36.015 --> 00:56:38.717
I want to hear
what she says.

00:56:38.751 --> 00:56:40.886
Thank you, Your Grace.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.523
Do you deny
your father's crime?

00:56:43.557 --> 00:56:48.028
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.

00:56:48.062 --> 00:56:50.063
All I ask is mercy.

00:56:50.098 --> 00:56:52.967
I know My Lord father
must regret what he did.

00:56:53.001 --> 00:56:55.303
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

00:56:55.337 --> 00:56:57.538
You all know he loved him.

00:56:57.573 --> 00:57:01.175
He never wanted to be Hand
until the King asked him.

00:57:01.209 --> 00:57:04.611
They must have lied to him--
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis

00:57:04.645 --> 00:57:07.447
or somebody.
They must have lied!

00:57:07.482 --> 00:57:09.950
He said
I wasn't the King.

00:57:09.984 --> 00:57:12.051
Why did he say that?

00:57:12.086 --> 00:57:14.354
He was badly hurt.

00:57:14.388 --> 00:57:17.256
Maester Pycelle was giving
him milk of the poppy.

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:21.460
He wasn't himself. Otherwise h
never would have said it.

00:57:23.796 --> 00:57:27.666
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:31.370
And yet they say
wisdom oft comes

00:57:31.405 --> 00:57:33.239
from the mouths of babes.

00:57:33.273 --> 00:57:37.410
Treason
is treason!

00:57:40.548 --> 00:57:42.715
Anything else?

00:57:44.285 --> 00:57:47.687
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

00:57:47.721 --> 00:57:51.223
please do me
this kindness, Your Grace.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.067
Your sweet words
have moved me.

00:58:05.471 --> 00:58:08.038
But your father has
to confess.

00:58:08.073 --> 00:58:11.675
He has to confess
and say that I'm the King...

00:58:14.578 --> 00:58:16.713
Or there'll be
no mercy for him.

00:58:21.185 --> 00:58:23.286
He will.
