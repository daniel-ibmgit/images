WEBVTT

00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:01.925
Arya Stark,
come with us.

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:03.229
Your father wants
to see you.

00:00:03.264 --> 00:00:04.905
My father wouldn't
send you.

00:00:07.786 --> 00:00:09.893
Go.

00:00:09.928 --> 00:00:12.472
- Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- If they'd been dead

00:00:12.507 --> 00:00:15.513
- for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:17.552
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:19.122
You are the daughter
of a traitor.

00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:21.029
How can I allow you
to marry my son?

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.505
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.078
If you would help your father,
urge your brother to come

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:28.553
to King's Landing and swear
his fealty to Joffrey.

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:30.157
His Grace summons me
to King's Landing,

00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:32.733
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:33.936
Call the banners.

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:38.481
Snow?

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.897
It is said that the men of the Mountain
clans are great warriors.

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:45.334
Ride with me
against my enemies

00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:48.107
and you shall have all
my son promised you and more.

00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:50.948
Only if the half man
fights with us.

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:57.067
His wound must be
washed and sewn

00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:59.576
or it will fester.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.750
I'm giving you half
of our forces--

00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:04.186
30,000 men.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.392
We need to break
Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:10.099
The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.

00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:12.907
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:14.777
To do either we need
to cross the river.

00:01:14.812 --> 00:01:17.115
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.757
Some men takes their oaths
more seriously than others.

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:23.563
I ask mercy
for my father.  Please.

00:01:23.598 --> 00:01:25.266
Your father has
to confess

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:27.472
and say
that I'm the King...

00:01:27.507 --> 00:01:29.910
Or there'll be
no mercy for him.

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:39.645
You've seen
better days, My Lord.

00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:42.949
Another visit?

00:03:44.317 --> 00:03:46.718
It seems
you're my last friend.

00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:49.521
No no,
many still love you.

00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:52.823
Sansa came to court
this morning

00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:54.992
to plead for your life.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.795
On her knees,
begging for me, hmmm.

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.797
Did you laugh
with the others?

00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:02.632
You do me wrong, My Lord.

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:04.867
Your blood is
the last thing I want.

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.702
I don't know
what you want.

00:04:06.736 --> 00:04:08.670
I've given up
trying to guess.

00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:14.142
When I was still a boy--

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.379
before they cut my balls off
with a hot knife--

00:04:17.413 --> 00:04:21.716
I traveled with a group
of actors through the Free Cities.

00:04:23.286 --> 00:04:26.287
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

00:04:26.322 --> 00:04:29.223
The same is true
at court.

00:04:29.258 --> 00:04:31.592
I am the master
of whisperers.

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:35.495
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.931
I'm a good actor,
My Lord.

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:41.467
Huh.
Can you free me from this pit?

00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:43.234
I could.

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:44.902
But will I?

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:47.570
No.

00:04:47.605 --> 00:04:49.438
As I said,
I'm no hero.

00:04:49.473 --> 00:04:51.506
What do you want?
Tell me.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.507
No riddles, no stories--
tell me, what do you want?

00:04:56.142 --> 00:04:58.209
Peace.

00:04:58.243 --> 00:05:01.044
Did you know that
your son is marching south

00:05:01.078 --> 00:05:04.146
with an army of Northmen?
Loyal lad--

00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:06.816
fighting for
his father's freedom.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.084
Robb?

00:05:09.118 --> 00:05:11.118
He's just a boy.

00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:13.587
Boys have been
conquerors before.

00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:15.922
But the man giving Cersei
sleepless nights

00:05:15.957 --> 00:05:19.525
is the King's--
the late King's brother.

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:23.028
Lord Stannis has the best
claim to the Throne,

00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:26.264
he is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

00:05:26.298 --> 00:05:28.432
Stannis Baratheon
is Robert's true heir.

00:05:28.466 --> 00:05:30.734
The Throne
is his by rights.

00:05:30.768 --> 00:05:35.304
Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded
so sweetly for your life,

00:05:35.338 --> 00:05:37.573
it would be a shame
to throw it away.

00:05:37.607 --> 00:05:40.342
Cersei is no fool.

00:05:40.377 --> 00:05:44.379
She knows a tame wolf is more
use to her than a dead one.

00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:47.181
You want me to serve the
woman who murdered my King,

00:05:47.215 --> 00:05:49.950
who butchered my men,
who crippled my son?

00:05:49.985 --> 00:05:52.053
I want you
to serve the realm!

00:05:52.087 --> 00:05:54.823
Tell the Queen you will confess
your vile treason,

00:05:54.858 --> 00:05:57.126
tell your son
to lay down his sword

00:05:57.161 --> 00:06:00.430
and proclaim Joffrey
as the true heir.

00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:05.335
Cersei knows you
as a man of honor.

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:07.437
If you give her
the peace she needs

00:06:07.472 --> 00:06:10.340
and promise to carry
her secret to your grave,

00:06:10.374 --> 00:06:14.176
I believe she will allow you to take
the Black and live out your days

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.644
on the Wall with your brother
and your bastard son.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.747
You think my life is
some precious thing to me?

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:25.585
That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of...

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.387
Of what?

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.260
You grew up with actors.

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:39.564
You learned their craft
and you learned it well.

00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:42.199
But I grew up
with soldiers.

00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:47.370
I learned how to die
a long time ago.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.174
Pity.

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:54.476
Such a pity.

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:03.584
What of your
daughter's life, My Lord?

00:07:03.618 --> 00:07:06.720
Is that a precious
thing to you?

00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:50.486
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

00:07:50.521 --> 00:07:52.622
Or so Walder Frey
would have you think.

00:07:52.656 --> 00:07:54.957
Keep shooting them down.
We can't risk Lord Walder

00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:57.592
sending word of your movements
to the Lannisters.

00:07:57.627 --> 00:08:00.628
He's grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

00:08:00.663 --> 00:08:04.597
Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

00:08:04.632 --> 00:08:06.733
Look.

00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:09.802
Father rots
in a dungeon.

00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:11.870
How long before
they take his head?

00:08:11.904 --> 00:08:15.206
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.641
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:20.644
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:24.047
Not in time. Tywin Lannister
marches north as we speak.

00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:26.815
The Freys have held
the crossing for 600 years,

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:30.251
and for 600 years they have never
failed to exact their toll.

00:08:30.285 --> 00:08:32.119
Have my horse
saddled and ready.

00:08:32.153 --> 00:08:35.856
Enter the Twins alone
and he'll sell you to the Lannis.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.724
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

00:08:41.194 --> 00:08:44.163
My father would do whatever
it took to secure our crossing.

00:08:44.198 --> 00:08:46.399
Whatever it took.

00:08:46.433 --> 00:08:48.334
If I'm going
to lead this army,

00:08:48.369 --> 00:08:50.871
I can't have other men
doing my bargaining for me.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.441
I agree.

00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:56.010
- I'll go.
- You can't!

00:08:56.044 --> 00:08:58.645
I have known Lord Walder
since I was a girl.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:00.313
He would never
harm me.

00:09:00.348 --> 00:09:02.982
Unless there was
a profit in it.

00:09:08.588 --> 00:09:10.488
What do you want?

00:09:10.523 --> 00:09:14.190
It is a great pleasure to see you
again after so many years, My Lord.

00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:16.025
Oh spare me.

00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:19.028
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

00:09:19.062 --> 00:09:22.330
What am I supposed
to do with you?

00:09:22.365 --> 00:09:25.700
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here--

00:09:25.734 --> 00:09:29.169
Who asked you?
You're not Lord Frey yet,

00:09:29.204 --> 00:09:31.671
not until I die.
Do I look dead to you?

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.616
Father, please--

00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:35.254
I need lessons in courtesy
from you, bastard?

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:38.143
Your mother would still
be a milkmaid

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:41.079
if I hadn't squirted you
into her belly.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.818
All right,
you come forward.

00:09:59.296 --> 00:10:01.663
There. Now that I've observed
the courtesies,

00:10:01.697 --> 00:10:05.366
perhaps my sons will do me the honor
of shutting their mouths.

00:10:10.672 --> 00:10:12.672
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

00:10:12.706 --> 00:10:15.608
We're talking
right now.

00:10:18.878 --> 00:10:20.412
Fine.

00:10:20.446 --> 00:10:23.080
Out! All of you!

00:10:33.058 --> 00:10:34.925
You too.

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:44.300
You see that?

00:10:44.335 --> 00:10:45.935
15 she is.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.404
A little flower.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.941
And her honey's all mine.

00:10:54.977 --> 00:10:57.479
I'm sure she will
give you many sons.

00:10:57.513 --> 00:11:01.249
Huh. Your father didn't
come to the wedding.

00:11:01.283 --> 00:11:03.618
He is quite ill, My Lord.

00:11:03.652 --> 00:11:06.554
Didn't come to
the last one either.

00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:09.057
Or the one before that.

00:11:10.593 --> 00:11:12.660
Your family has always
pissed on me.

00:11:12.694 --> 00:11:15.495
- My Lord, I--
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.898
The fine Lord Tully

00:11:17.932 --> 00:11:20.199
would never marry any
of his children to mine.

00:11:20.233 --> 00:11:22.167
I'm sure there
were reasons why--

00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:24.836
I didn't need reasons.
I needed to get rid

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.406
of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:34.577
Why are you here?

00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:37.245
To ask you

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.580
to open your gates,
My Lord,

00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:44.095
so my son and his bannermen may cross
the Trident and be on their way.

00:11:44.096 --> 00:11:45.329
Why should I let him?

00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:47.303
If you could climb
your own battlements,

00:11:47.655 --> 00:11:51.157
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:54.593
They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

00:11:54.628 --> 00:11:57.095
Don't try and frighten me,
Lady Stark.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.664
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:02.600
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

00:12:02.634 --> 00:12:05.069
You swore an oath
to my father.

00:12:05.103 --> 00:12:07.371
Oh yes, I said some words...

00:12:07.405 --> 00:12:11.240
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

00:12:11.275 --> 00:12:15.076
Joffrey's King now,
which makes your boy

00:12:15.111 --> 00:12:18.646
and his corpses-to-be nothing
but rebels, it seems to me.

00:12:20.148 --> 00:12:22.515
If I had the sense
the Gods gave a fish,

00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:24.584
I'd hand you both
over to the Lannisters.

00:12:24.618 --> 00:12:27.153
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully,

00:12:27.187 --> 00:12:29.455
Lannister, Baratheon,

00:12:29.523 --> 00:12:32.157
give me one good reason

00:12:32.192 --> 00:12:35.627
why I should waste
a single thought on any of you?

00:12:35.661 --> 00:12:38.997
And... engage.

00:12:40.197 --> 00:12:42.530
When does Aemon think you'll
be able to use that hand?

00:12:42.802 --> 00:12:45.636
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:49.640
You'll be ready
for this then.

00:12:49.675 --> 00:12:52.910
I thought a wolf was
more appropriate for you

00:12:52.944 --> 00:12:55.012
than a bear...

00:12:55.047 --> 00:12:59.016
So I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.885
Works as well for a wolf
as a bear, I think.

00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:16.396
This is Valyrian steel.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.198
It was my father's sword,

00:13:19.232 --> 00:13:21.100
his father before him.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:24.736
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.838
It was meant
for my son Jorah.

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.607
He brought dishonor
to our House,

00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:32.143
but he had the grace
to leave the sword

00:13:32.177 --> 00:13:34.946
before he fled
from Westeros.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.315
My Lord, you honor me,
but I can't--

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:39.916
Oh, you can
and you will.

00:13:39.951 --> 00:13:44.286
I wouldn't be standing here if it
wasn't for you and your beast.

00:13:45.822 --> 00:13:48.590
A bloody dead man
tried to kill me...

00:13:50.225 --> 00:13:53.427
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

00:13:53.462 --> 00:13:56.196
- Is that understood?
- Yes, My Lord.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.298
Right.
Now don't think this means

00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:01.634
I approve
of this nonsense

00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:03.736
with you
and Alliser Thorne.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.304
That's a man's sword,

00:14:06.339 --> 00:14:09.007
it'll take
a man to wield it.

00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:11.043
I'll apologize
to Ser Alliser tonight.

00:14:11.078 --> 00:14:12.511
No you won't!

00:14:12.546 --> 00:14:14.613
I sent him to King's Landing
yesterday.

00:14:14.647 --> 00:14:16.849
The hand that your wolf

00:14:16.883 --> 00:14:18.450
tore off
that thing's wrist--

00:14:18.485 --> 00:14:22.187
I've ordered Thorne to lay it
at the feet of this...

00:14:22.221 --> 00:14:24.055
Boy King.

00:14:24.089 --> 00:14:26.924
That should get young
Joffrey's attention.

00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.459
And it puts
a thousand leagues

00:14:30.493 --> 00:14:33.261
between you and Thorne.

00:14:33.295 --> 00:14:35.797
Now go and put your sword
somewhere safe

00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:38.432
and bring me
my supper.

00:14:38.466 --> 00:14:40.933
Yes, My Lord.

00:14:51.478 --> 00:14:54.045
- Well done.
- Well done.

00:14:55.848 --> 00:14:57.816
You earned that, Snow.

00:15:01.686 --> 00:15:03.819
Well done.

00:15:08.222 --> 00:15:09.555
Go on,
let's have a look.

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:11.991
- At what?
- The sword! Show us the sword.

00:15:12.025 --> 00:15:15.228
Sword! Sword!
Sword! Sword!

00:15:23.671 --> 00:15:25.305
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.341
Get off of it.
Piss off.

00:15:28.376 --> 00:15:30.810
Come on, I want to have
a look at it in the light.

00:15:34.315 --> 00:15:36.383
Give it here!

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:38.285
What is it?

00:15:38.319 --> 00:15:40.387
- I--
- Look at its eyes.

00:15:40.421 --> 00:15:41.955
- Give it.
- I can't.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.758
You can't what?

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:49.328
I-- I'm really not
supposed to say.

00:15:49.363 --> 00:15:52.831
And yet you really
want to say.

00:15:52.865 --> 00:15:55.600
You want to say
that...?

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.872
There was a raven.

00:16:00.906 --> 00:16:03.274
I read the message
to Maester Aemon.

00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:07.077
It's your brother Robb.

00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:09.245
What?

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.080
What about him?

00:16:12.415 --> 00:16:14.049
He's heading south.

00:16:14.084 --> 00:16:15.951
To war.

00:16:17.854 --> 00:16:21.289
All his bannermen have rallied
to his side. They'll keep him safe.

00:16:23.092 --> 00:16:25.459
I should be there.

00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:29.796
I should be with him.

00:16:43.642 --> 00:16:46.142
...If we do that, they'll never
get back across.

00:16:47.845 --> 00:16:49.712
Well?

00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:52.247
What did he say?

00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:55.149
Lord Walder has granted
your crossing.

00:16:56.885 --> 00:17:00.120
- His men are yours as well--
- Huh.

00:17:00.154 --> 00:17:02.355
--Less the 400 he will keep here
to hold the crossing

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.091
against any who would
pursue you.

00:17:04.125 --> 00:17:05.526
And what does
he want in return?

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.162
You will be taking on his son
Olyvar as your personal squire.

00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:12.899
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine fine.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.335
And?

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.371
And Arya

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:21.573
will marry his son Waldron

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:24.676
- when they both come of age.
- She won't be happy about that.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.444
Hmmm.

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:30.815
And?

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:34.552
And

00:17:34.587 --> 00:17:37.622
when the fighting
is done...

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:41.526
You will marry
one of his daughters.

00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:44.496
Whichever you prefer.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.033
He has a number he thinks
will be... suitable.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.135
I see.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.272
Did you get a look at his daughters?

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:56.073
I did.

00:17:56.107 --> 00:17:58.341
And?

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.544
One was...

00:18:07.117 --> 00:18:08.817
Do you consent?

00:18:08.852 --> 00:18:10.786
Can I refuse?

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.987
Not if you want to cross.

00:18:16.424 --> 00:18:18.459
Then I consent.

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:05.600
Sam said you wanted
to see me?

00:19:05.634 --> 00:19:07.502
I did indeed.

00:19:07.536 --> 00:19:11.201
Perhaps you would be
kind enough to assist me.

00:19:14.504 --> 00:19:16.939
Tell me,
did you ever wonder

00:19:16.973 --> 00:19:19.841
why the men
of The Night's Watch

00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:22.743
take no wives
and father no children?

00:19:22.778 --> 00:19:24.878
No.

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:27.347
So they will not love.

00:19:27.381 --> 00:19:30.916
Love is the death
of duty.

00:19:30.951 --> 00:19:34.920
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose

00:19:34.954 --> 00:19:37.555
between honor
on the one hand

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.224
and those he loves
on the other,

00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:42.293
what would he do?

00:19:42.327 --> 00:19:46.696
He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

00:19:46.731 --> 00:19:51.501
Then Lord Stark
is one man in 10,000.

00:19:51.535 --> 00:19:54.670
Most of us are not
so strong.

00:19:54.704 --> 00:19:56.538
What is honor

00:19:56.572 --> 00:19:59.174
compared
to a woman's love?

00:19:59.208 --> 00:20:01.776
And what is duty

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.346
against the feel of a newborn son
in your arms?

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.049
Or a brother's smile?

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:13.786
Sam told you.

00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:15.721
We're all human.

00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:19.323
Oh, we all do our duty when
there's no cost to it.

00:20:19.358 --> 00:20:22.159
Honor comes easy then.

00:20:22.193 --> 00:20:25.129
Yet sooner or later

00:20:25.163 --> 00:20:28.031
in every man's life

00:20:28.066 --> 00:20:30.934
there comes a day
when it is not easy,

00:20:30.968 --> 00:20:34.236
a day when
he must choose.

00:20:36.072 --> 00:20:38.039
And this is my day?

00:20:38.073 --> 00:20:40.174
Is that what
you're saying?

00:20:40.209 --> 00:20:43.344
Oh, it hurts, boy.
Oh yes.

00:20:43.378 --> 00:20:46.446
- I know.
- You do not know!

00:20:48.082 --> 00:20:50.250
No one knows.

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:54.153
I may be a bastard,

00:20:54.188 --> 00:20:56.656
but he is my father
and Robb is my brother.

00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:04.798
The Gods were cruel when they
saw fit to test my vows.

00:21:04.833 --> 00:21:07.302
They waited till I was old.

00:21:09.005 --> 00:21:12.441
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South--

00:21:12.475 --> 00:21:15.376
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

00:21:15.411 --> 00:21:18.045
I was helpless,

00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:20.880
blind, frail.

00:21:22.482 --> 00:21:25.584
But when I heard

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:28.219
they had killed
my brother's son,

00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:30.321
and his poor son...

00:21:30.355 --> 00:21:31.788
And the children!

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:35.025
Even the little children.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.127
Who are you?

00:21:40.197 --> 00:21:43.999
My father was Maekar,

00:21:44.033 --> 00:21:46.367
the first of his name.

00:21:46.401 --> 00:21:50.604
My brother Aegon
reigned after him

00:21:50.638 --> 00:21:53.606
when I had refused
the Throne.

00:21:53.641 --> 00:21:57.210
And he was followed
by his son Aerys,

00:21:57.244 --> 00:21:59.912
whom they called
the Mad King.

00:21:59.946 --> 00:22:03.248
You're Aemon Targaryen.

00:22:03.282 --> 00:22:06.217
I'm a Maester
of the Citadel,

00:22:06.252 --> 00:22:11.789
bound in service to Castle Black
and The Night's Watch.

00:22:13.825 --> 00:22:18.061
I will not tell you
to stay or go.

00:22:18.095 --> 00:22:21.564
You must make
that choice yourself,

00:22:21.598 --> 00:22:25.600
and live with it
for the rest of your days.

00:22:28.003 --> 00:22:30.037
As I have.

00:22:55.759 --> 00:22:57.659
Drogo.

00:23:06.199 --> 00:23:08.936
Sajo anni.

00:24:02.754 --> 00:24:04.455
Hyah hyah.

00:24:24.206 --> 00:24:25.873
Our scouts tell us

00:24:25.908 --> 00:24:28.576
the Stark host has moved
south from the Twins

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.311
with Lord Frey's levies
in tow.

00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:33.446
They're a day's
march north.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.149
The boy may lack
experience and sense,

00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:39.252
but he does have
a certain mindless

00:24:39.286 --> 00:24:42.588
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

00:24:46.058 --> 00:24:48.325
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.861
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

00:24:50.895 --> 00:24:52.863
otherwise we've wasted
good steel on them.

00:24:52.897 --> 00:24:56.299
The great hairy one insisted he
must have two battle axes--

00:24:56.333 --> 00:24:58.868
heavy black steel,
double-sided.

00:24:58.902 --> 00:25:00.836
Shagga likes axes.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.471
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings

00:25:03.506 --> 00:25:05.706
will be in the vanguard.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.174
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hmm.

00:25:07.208 --> 00:25:09.075
Me and the tribesmen
on the front lines?

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.613
They do seem
rather ferocious.

00:25:14.783 --> 00:25:17.986
Ferocious?
Last night

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.656
a Moon Brother stabbed
a Stone Crow over a sausage.

00:25:21.691 --> 00:25:25.561
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon
Brother and opened his throat.

00:25:25.596 --> 00:25:28.564
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from
chopping off the dead man's cock,

00:25:28.599 --> 00:25:30.800
which was fortunate,
but even still

00:25:30.834 --> 00:25:32.635
Ulf is demanding
blood money,

00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:35.271
which Shagga and Gunthor
refuse to pay.

00:25:35.305 --> 00:25:38.407
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

00:25:38.442 --> 00:25:39.975
Surely there are ways
to have me killed

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.045
that would be less detrimental
to the war effort.

00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:44.781
There'll be no more
discussion on the matter.

00:25:49.019 --> 00:25:52.221
It appears I'm not
hungry after all.

00:25:52.255 --> 00:25:54.123
Excuse me, My Lords.

00:26:06.768 --> 00:26:09.803
Where did you find one
so pretty at this hour?

00:26:09.837 --> 00:26:12.572
- I took her.
- Took her?

00:26:12.606 --> 00:26:15.641
- From whom?
- From, uh...

00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:17.542
Ser-- what's his name?

00:26:17.577 --> 00:26:20.278
I don't know.
Ginger cunt three tents down.

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:23.515
And he didn't have anything
to say about it?

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:27.051
He said something.

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:32.121
Well, the odds of me
living long enough

00:26:32.156 --> 00:26:34.757
for him to retaliate
just dropped drastically.

00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:37.192
We'll be at
the vanguard tomorrow.

00:26:39.862 --> 00:26:42.062
Oh well.

00:26:43.331 --> 00:26:47.367
I... think I'll go
and find myself one.

00:26:50.905 --> 00:26:52.337
Who are you?

00:26:52.371 --> 00:26:54.672
Who would you like me to be?

00:26:54.673 --> 00:26:57.108
What did your mother
call you?

00:26:57.142 --> 00:26:58.894
Shae.

00:26:58.919 --> 00:27:00.655
What did your
mother call you?

00:27:00.846 --> 00:27:03.248
My mother died
giving birth to me.

00:27:03.282 --> 00:27:06.818
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

00:27:06.853 --> 00:27:10.354
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

00:27:10.422 --> 00:27:12.222
For--

00:27:13.624 --> 00:27:15.358
What do you want
from me?

00:27:15.393 --> 00:27:18.127
What do I want from you?

00:27:18.161 --> 00:27:21.497
I want you to share my tent.

00:27:21.531 --> 00:27:24.566
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.403
rub my legs when they're
sore after a day's ride.

00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:29.705
I want you to take
no other man to bed

00:27:29.739 --> 00:27:31.706
for as long
as we're together.

00:27:31.741 --> 00:27:35.910
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world--

00:27:35.944 --> 00:27:38.213
which it may well be.

00:27:38.247 --> 00:27:39.849
And what do I get?

00:27:39.883 --> 00:27:43.119
Safety.

00:27:43.153 --> 00:27:45.889
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

00:27:46.958 --> 00:27:49.291
The pleasure
of my company,

00:27:49.326 --> 00:27:52.293
which I have heard
is spectacular.

00:27:52.328 --> 00:27:54.662
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

00:27:54.696 --> 00:27:57.798
And three: More gold

00:27:57.832 --> 00:28:01.300
than you can spend if you
lived a thousand years.

00:28:01.334 --> 00:28:04.436
Do you accept my proposal?

00:28:22.684 --> 00:28:25.986
Let's start with your last night
in this world.

00:28:45.706 --> 00:28:47.706
Doth-- Dothrae...

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.172
Ki ha-- hammi...

00:28:51.207 --> 00:28:54.908
Ish nokitta...

00:28:54.943 --> 00:28:56.910
Qana'th...

00:28:58.879 --> 00:29:00.280
Khaleesi.

00:29:00.314 --> 00:29:01.714
Come.

00:29:04.084 --> 00:29:06.118
He's very strong.

00:29:06.152 --> 00:29:09.287
No one understands
how strong he is.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:31.172
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:33.908
He can't.
I won't let him.

00:29:33.942 --> 00:29:37.177
Even a Queen doesn't
have that power.

00:29:39.847 --> 00:29:43.082
We must go quickly. I've heard
there's a good port in Asshai--

00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:47.319
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

00:29:47.353 --> 00:29:49.387
Doth--

00:29:49.422 --> 00:29:51.322
Even if--

00:29:51.357 --> 00:29:54.425
--Even if he dies,

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.262
why would I run?

00:29:57.296 --> 00:29:59.497
I am Khaleesi

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:03.134
and my-- my son will be
Khal after Drogo.

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:06.237
This isn't Westeros
where men honor blood.

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:09.273
Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:11.108
after Drogo dies.

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:13.778
Whoever wins that fight
will be the new Khal.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:16.013
He won't want any rivals.

00:30:16.048 --> 00:30:18.649
Your boy will be plucked
from your breast

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:20.851
and given to the dogs.

00:30:20.886 --> 00:30:24.588
I won't leave him.

00:30:34.099 --> 00:30:37.067
The wound
has festered.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.958
I think you should wear
your armor tonight, Ser.

00:31:39.992 --> 00:31:42.593
I think you're right.

00:31:47.131 --> 00:31:48.799
You've saved me
once more.

00:31:48.833 --> 00:31:51.468
And now you must
save him.

00:31:51.503 --> 00:31:53.871
He's beyond
the healer's skills.

00:31:53.905 --> 00:31:56.606
All I can do is
ease his path.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.774
Save him and I will free you.
I swear it.

00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:02.078
You must know a way...

00:32:02.112 --> 00:32:03.946
Some...

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.847
Some magic.

00:32:08.451 --> 00:32:10.351
There is a spell.

00:32:10.385 --> 00:32:12.619
Some would say death
is cleaner.

00:32:23.431 --> 00:32:25.165
Do it.

00:32:25.199 --> 00:32:27.266
Save him.

00:32:27.301 --> 00:32:29.100
There is a price.

00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:30.639
You'll have gold--
whatever you want.

00:32:30.703 --> 00:32:33.137
It's not a matter of gold.
This is Bloodmagic.

00:32:33.172 --> 00:32:35.439
Only death pays for life.

00:32:38.609 --> 00:32:40.342
My death?

00:32:40.377 --> 00:32:43.378
No.
Not your death, Khaleesi.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.548
Bring me his horse.

00:33:09.974 --> 00:33:11.608
Khaleesi,
do not do this thing.

00:33:11.642 --> 00:33:15.411
- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your Khal.

00:33:15.445 --> 00:33:18.247
This is Bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

00:33:18.281 --> 00:33:22.050
I am your Khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

00:33:32.328 --> 00:33:33.762
Go now!

00:33:33.796 --> 00:33:35.998
- Take her and leave.
- Huh-uh.

00:33:36.032 --> 00:33:38.200
Take her!

00:33:40.503 --> 00:33:41.637
Irriya?

00:33:42.905 --> 00:33:44.473
You must go also, lady.

00:33:44.507 --> 00:33:46.808
Once I begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

00:33:46.843 --> 00:33:49.611
The dead will
dance here tonight.

00:34:02.191 --> 00:34:04.693
No one will enter.

00:34:12.802 --> 00:34:15.237
Bring him back to me.

00:34:31.721 --> 00:34:33.622
What have you done?

00:34:33.656 --> 00:34:35.957
I have to save him.

00:34:35.992 --> 00:34:39.127
We could have been 10 miles away from
here by now on the way to Asshai.

00:34:39.162 --> 00:34:41.363
You would have been safe.

00:34:47.503 --> 00:34:49.771
Jíni'th vos eo.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:55.577
Mra qothoon vosaan--

00:34:57.847 --> 00:34:59.981
Khaleesi!

00:35:43.956 --> 00:35:45.590
Are you hurt?

00:35:45.624 --> 00:35:47.091
- The baby...
- Hmm?

00:35:47.126 --> 00:35:48.760
...Is coming.

00:35:48.794 --> 00:35:51.329
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come.

00:35:51.364 --> 00:35:53.365
They say
she is cursed.

00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:55.935
They'll come or I'll
have their heads.

00:35:57.204 --> 00:35:59.705
The witch--
she can bring baby.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.276
I hear her say so.

00:36:24.491 --> 00:36:26.224
Are you in agony,
my lion?

00:36:26.258 --> 00:36:28.826
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:32.229
The fire is burning
your pretty soft skin.

00:36:35.432 --> 00:36:37.500
Ahhh.

00:36:39.169 --> 00:36:41.937
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:44.172
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

00:36:46.208 --> 00:36:48.943
Let's play a new game.

00:36:48.977 --> 00:36:52.078
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you--

00:36:52.113 --> 00:36:54.914
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

00:36:54.949 --> 00:36:57.916
- Not if you win.
- No!

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.451
No more fire games,
no knife games.

00:37:00.485 --> 00:37:03.387
Let's do something
I'm good at.

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:05.622
What are you good at?

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:07.623
I happen to be a great
judge of character.

00:37:07.658 --> 00:37:10.058
- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

00:37:10.092 --> 00:37:12.861
Here's how it works:
I make a statement

00:37:12.895 --> 00:37:15.330
about your past.
If I'm right,

00:37:15.364 --> 00:37:17.598
you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

00:37:17.633 --> 00:37:20.333
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

00:37:20.367 --> 00:37:22.435
I don't want to play
this game.

00:37:22.469 --> 00:37:24.670
Fine.
Bronn first.

00:37:28.575 --> 00:37:31.009
Your father beat you.

00:37:36.147 --> 00:37:38.614
But my mother
hit harder.

00:37:41.351 --> 00:37:44.553
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

00:37:44.587 --> 00:37:46.488
It was a woman.

00:37:48.958 --> 00:37:51.125
She swung
an axe at me.

00:37:52.727 --> 00:37:54.461
You've been
North of the Wall.

00:37:57.498 --> 00:37:59.599
What brought you
up there?

00:38:00.768 --> 00:38:01.902
Work.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.971
And...

00:38:03.972 --> 00:38:06.040
You once loved a woman
many years ago,

00:38:06.074 --> 00:38:09.343
but it turned out badly so you've
never let yourself love again.

00:38:11.145 --> 00:38:13.580
Oh wait, that's me.

00:38:16.784 --> 00:38:19.652
Your turn, my mysterious
foreign beauty.

00:38:19.687 --> 00:38:21.521
I don't want to play.

00:38:21.555 --> 00:38:25.425
It's fun!
Look at the fun we're having.

00:38:28.562 --> 00:38:30.096
Your mother
was a whore.

00:38:31.531 --> 00:38:33.933
Drink.

00:38:39.473 --> 00:38:41.373
All right.

00:38:41.408 --> 00:38:44.143
Your father left the family when
you were very young,

00:38:44.177 --> 00:38:46.178
- never to return.
- Drink.

00:38:47.386 --> 00:38:49.137
And we've established
the rules about lying?

00:38:49.162 --> 00:38:50.362
Drink!

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.288
Mmmm.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:59.524
You wanted
a different life.

00:38:59.559 --> 00:39:02.693
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

00:39:02.728 --> 00:39:05.296
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.598
So specifics--

00:39:07.632 --> 00:39:10.835
you wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

00:39:10.869 --> 00:39:14.539
I don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

00:39:14.573 --> 00:39:18.843
So what's
a lowborn girl to do?

00:39:22.214 --> 00:39:24.448
Drink.

00:39:26.184 --> 00:39:29.153
- Are you sure--
- drink!

00:39:33.692 --> 00:39:37.362
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever

00:39:37.397 --> 00:39:40.834
or I will carve your eyes
from your head.

00:39:44.371 --> 00:39:47.406
My dear lady, if I have
offended you, I apologize.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.607
My turn.

00:39:49.642 --> 00:39:52.043
Fine fine.

00:39:52.077 --> 00:39:54.378
Ask away.

00:39:54.412 --> 00:39:57.481
Try to penetrate
the enigma that is me.

00:39:57.515 --> 00:40:00.283
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

00:40:00.317 --> 00:40:02.651
I don't care the way
the game works.

00:40:02.686 --> 00:40:04.787
Our Lord here
used to be married.

00:40:05.889 --> 00:40:07.890
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

00:40:07.924 --> 00:40:11.461
You hear lots of things playing
dice with Lannister soldiers.

00:40:13.898 --> 00:40:15.199
Another night,
perhaps.

00:40:15.233 --> 00:40:18.536
Not another night.
This night.

00:40:19.973 --> 00:40:21.707
It's not
a pleasant story.

00:40:23.745 --> 00:40:26.882
- Or maybe I will cry.
- I'm guessing the lady and I

00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:29.652
can tell more unpleasant stories
than your Lordship.

00:40:32.052 --> 00:40:34.319
So...

00:40:37.523 --> 00:40:41.126
I was 16. My brother Jaime
and I were riding

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.862
when we heard a scream.
She ran out onto the road,

00:40:44.896 --> 00:40:47.563
clothes half torn off
with two men on her heels.

00:40:47.598 --> 00:40:52.133
Jaime scared away the men easily
enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.

00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:54.222
She was too scared to send off
on her own,

00:40:54.247 --> 00:40:56.094
so while Jaime
hunted down the rapers

00:40:56.138 --> 00:40:59.273
I took her to the nearest
inn and fed her.

00:40:59.307 --> 00:41:02.075
Her name was Tysha.

00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:04.344
She was
a wheelwright's orphan.

00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:06.512
And she was hungry--

00:41:06.547 --> 00:41:09.949
together we finished off
three chickens and a flagon of wine.

00:41:09.983 --> 00:41:13.384
Impossible as it seems, there was a
time when I was unaccustomed to wine.

00:41:13.419 --> 00:41:16.253
I forgot how afraid
I was around girls,

00:41:16.288 --> 00:41:19.691
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me

00:41:19.725 --> 00:41:22.159
or look away embarrassed

00:41:22.194 --> 00:41:24.594
or ask me about my tall
handsome brother.

00:41:24.629 --> 00:41:27.731
I forgot about
everything but Tysha.

00:41:28.999 --> 00:41:31.367
And somehow I found
myself in her bed.

00:41:31.401 --> 00:41:33.836
For three chickens,
I should hope so.

00:41:33.871 --> 00:41:37.740
It didn't last long. I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.

00:41:37.775 --> 00:41:40.376
But she was good to me.

00:41:40.411 --> 00:41:42.512
She kissed me afterwards

00:41:42.546 --> 00:41:45.448
and sang me a song.

00:41:45.482 --> 00:41:50.587
And by morning I was deep enough
in love to ask for her hand.

00:41:50.621 --> 00:41:53.323
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken Septon

00:41:53.357 --> 00:41:55.759
and there you have it--
man and wife.

00:41:55.793 --> 00:41:59.396
For a fortnight anyway,
until the Septon sobered up

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.464
and told my father.

00:42:01.499 --> 00:42:04.467
I imagine that was
the end of all that.

00:42:04.501 --> 00:42:06.535
Not quite.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:10.173
First, my father had
Jaime tell me the truth.

00:42:11.375 --> 00:42:14.310
The girl was a whore,
you see.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.814
Jaime had arranged
the whole thing,

00:42:17.848 --> 00:42:20.683
the road, the rapers--
all of it.

00:42:20.718 --> 00:42:23.319
He thought it was time
I had a woman.

00:42:25.289 --> 00:42:27.457
After my brother confessed,

00:42:27.491 --> 00:42:30.793
my father brought in my wife

00:42:30.828 --> 00:42:33.596
and gave her
to his guards.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:37.166
He paid her well--
a silver for each man.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.169
How many whores command
that kind of price?

00:42:41.705 --> 00:42:45.141
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

00:42:45.175 --> 00:42:48.577
By the end,
she had so much silver

00:42:48.611 --> 00:42:51.546
that the coins were
slipping through her fingers

00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:54.382
and rolling
onto the floor.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.122
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

00:43:00.156 --> 00:43:03.392
You should have known
she was a whore.

00:43:03.426 --> 00:43:05.727
Really?

00:43:05.761 --> 00:43:08.597
I was 16, drunk
and in love--

00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:10.532
A girl who
was almost raped

00:43:10.567 --> 00:43:13.535
doesn't invite another man
into her bed two hours later.

00:43:15.137 --> 00:43:19.440
As I said, I was
young and stupid.

00:43:21.643 --> 00:43:24.078
You are still
young and stupid.

00:43:47.401 --> 00:43:49.602
Hyah!

00:44:05.819 --> 00:44:07.453
What is it?
What do you want?

00:44:07.487 --> 00:44:09.322
You're sleeping
through the war.

00:44:09.356 --> 00:44:12.258
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

00:44:12.292 --> 00:44:14.526
They're a mile north.

00:44:14.561 --> 00:44:17.162
- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.

00:44:19.532 --> 00:44:21.866
If I die, weep for me.

00:44:23.101 --> 00:44:26.203
You'll be dead.
How will you know?

00:44:32.247 --> 00:44:34.214
I'll know.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:37.917
Watch out!
Move!

00:44:38.953 --> 00:44:40.520
Out of the way!

00:44:40.554 --> 00:44:42.923
- Move aside!

00:44:49.065 --> 00:44:50.932
stay low.

00:44:50.967 --> 00:44:53.068
Stay low?

00:44:53.102 --> 00:44:55.670
If you're lucky,
no one will notice you.

00:44:55.704 --> 00:44:58.240
I was born lucky.

00:45:00.943 --> 00:45:03.145
Tribesmen of the Vale,

00:45:03.179 --> 00:45:06.015
gather round!

00:45:06.049 --> 00:45:08.551
Stone Crows!

00:45:08.586 --> 00:45:10.853
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

00:45:10.887 --> 00:45:13.623
- Moon Brothers!
- And painted dogs!

00:45:13.657 --> 00:45:16.025
And painted dogs!

00:45:16.059 --> 00:45:19.528
Your dominion over
the Vale begins now!

00:45:19.562 --> 00:45:22.431
Onward to claim
what is yours!

00:45:22.465 --> 00:45:24.900
Half man! Half man!

00:45:24.934 --> 00:45:27.869
Half man!
Half man!

00:45:27.903 --> 00:45:31.105
Half man! Half man!

00:45:31.139 --> 00:45:33.073
To battle.

00:46:15.311 --> 00:46:17.646
You're a shit warrior.

00:46:19.682 --> 00:46:21.649
I'm alive?

00:46:21.684 --> 00:46:25.018
You're alive.

00:46:29.624 --> 00:46:31.424
Did we win?

00:46:31.459 --> 00:46:34.060
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

00:46:46.939 --> 00:46:49.741
How did our
tribesmen do?

00:46:50.877 --> 00:46:53.078
Yeah, good.

00:46:53.113 --> 00:46:56.248
It's nice to see them
getting along.

00:46:56.282 --> 00:46:58.350
You're wounded.

00:46:58.385 --> 00:47:01.585
Good of you to notice.

00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:03.720
I hear we won.

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:06.389
Hmph.
The scouts were wrong.

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:10.459
There were 2,000
Stark bannermen, not 20,000.

00:47:11.594 --> 00:47:13.629
Did we get the Stark boy,
at least?

00:47:13.663 --> 00:47:15.697
He wasn't here.

00:47:15.732 --> 00:47:17.566
Where was he?

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.268
With his other 18,000 men.

00:47:23.171 --> 00:47:25.639
And where are they?

00:47:35.748 --> 00:47:38.084
- We should go, My Lady.
- No!

00:47:42.921 --> 00:47:45.556
My Lady!

00:47:46.758 --> 00:47:49.292
Hyah hyah!

00:48:20.585 --> 00:48:24.321
By the time they knew what was
happening, it had already happened.

00:48:27.558 --> 00:48:29.759
Lady Stark.
I'd offer you my sword,

00:48:29.794 --> 00:48:31.794
but I seem
to have lost it.

00:48:31.828 --> 00:48:34.362
It's not your sword I want.

00:48:34.397 --> 00:48:37.031
Give me my daughters back.

00:48:37.098 --> 00:48:39.166
Give me my husband.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.401
I've lost them too,
I'm afraid.

00:48:41.435 --> 00:48:44.003
Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

00:48:44.037 --> 00:48:46.205
He cut down 10 of our men--
you saw him.

00:48:46.239 --> 00:48:49.141
He's more use
to us alive than dead.

00:48:49.175 --> 00:48:52.243
Take him away
and put him in irons.

00:48:52.278 --> 00:48:55.046
We could end this war
right now, boy,

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.114
save thousands of lives.

00:48:57.149 --> 00:49:00.017
You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

00:49:00.052 --> 00:49:03.319
Swords or lances, teeth, nails--
choose your weapons

00:49:03.353 --> 00:49:05.921
and let's end this
here and now.

00:49:08.123 --> 00:49:10.791
If we do it your way,
Kingslayer,

00:49:10.826 --> 00:49:13.526
you'd win.

00:49:15.729 --> 00:49:17.897
We're not doing it
your way.

00:49:19.833 --> 00:49:21.933
Come on, pretty man.

00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:33.111
I sent 2,000 men
to their graves today.

00:49:33.145 --> 00:49:35.680
The bards will sing songs
of their sacrifice.

00:49:35.714 --> 00:49:38.950
Aye. But the dead
won't hear them.

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:48.492
One victory does not
make us conquerors.

00:49:50.428 --> 00:49:53.063
Did we free my father?

00:49:53.097 --> 00:49:55.999
Did we rescue my sisters
from the Queen?

00:49:57.635 --> 00:50:01.172
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

00:50:05.877 --> 00:50:08.944
This war is far from over.

00:50:39.074 --> 00:50:41.041
Could I have one?

00:50:41.076 --> 00:50:43.677
A lemon one--
or any of them.

00:50:43.711 --> 00:50:45.245
Three coppers.

00:50:46.314 --> 00:50:47.847
How about
a nice fat pigeon?

00:50:47.882 --> 00:50:49.782
Piss off now.
Go on.

00:50:49.817 --> 00:50:52.685
Do you have any stale ones
from yesterday?

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.854
- Or any burnt ones?
- Piss off!

00:51:02.297 --> 00:51:04.665
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

00:51:04.699 --> 00:51:06.149
They're taking him
to the Sept of Baelor.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:07.043
Who?

00:51:07.044 --> 00:51:08.978
The Hand of the King.

00:52:16.539 --> 00:52:18.771
- Traitor!
- Coward!

00:52:18.805 --> 00:52:20.673
Baelor.

00:52:20.707 --> 00:52:22.340
Baelor!

00:52:28.013 --> 00:52:30.648
Traitor!
Traitor!

00:52:50.599 --> 00:52:52.700
I am Eddard Stark,

00:52:52.734 --> 00:52:55.134
Lord of Winterfell

00:52:55.169 --> 00:52:57.336
and Hand of the King.

00:53:06.178 --> 00:53:08.679
I come before you
to confess my treason

00:53:08.713 --> 00:53:12.115
in the sight of Gods
and men.

00:53:13.484 --> 00:53:15.552
I betrayed the faith
of my King

00:53:15.586 --> 00:53:18.955
and the trust
of my friend Robert.

00:53:20.224 --> 00:53:23.359
I swore to protect
and defend his children,

00:53:23.393 --> 00:53:25.761
but before his blood
was cold

00:53:25.795 --> 00:53:28.296
I plotted
to murder his son...

00:53:29.731 --> 00:53:32.066
And seize the Throne
for myself.

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.735
Traitor!

00:53:42.975 --> 00:53:45.043
Let the high Septon

00:53:45.077 --> 00:53:48.680
and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what I say:

00:53:51.184 --> 00:53:53.719
Joffrey Baratheon

00:53:53.753 --> 00:53:56.588
is the one true heir
to the Iron Throne,

00:53:56.622 --> 00:54:00.258
by the Grace
of all the gods,

00:54:00.292 --> 00:54:02.827
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

00:54:02.861 --> 00:54:05.129
and Protector
of the Realm.

00:54:11.504 --> 00:54:14.773
As we sin,

00:54:14.841 --> 00:54:16.742
so do we suffer.

00:54:16.776 --> 00:54:19.645
This man has
confessed his crimes

00:54:19.679 --> 00:54:22.348
in sight
of Gods and men.

00:54:22.382 --> 00:54:25.884
The Gods are just

00:54:25.919 --> 00:54:28.754
but beloved Baelor
taught us

00:54:28.788 --> 00:54:32.590
they can also be
merciful.

00:54:35.328 --> 00:54:36.995
What is to be done

00:54:37.029 --> 00:54:39.497
with this traitor,
Your Grace?

00:54:44.404 --> 00:54:47.506
My mother wishes me to let
Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch.

00:54:47.541 --> 00:54:50.209
Stripped of all titles
and powers,

00:54:50.243 --> 00:54:52.879
he would serve the realm
in permanent exile.

00:54:52.913 --> 00:54:54.614
And My Lady Sansa

00:54:54.648 --> 00:54:58.117
has begged mercy
for her father.

00:55:01.655 --> 00:55:04.790
But they have
the soft hearts of women.

00:55:04.825 --> 00:55:07.359
So long as I am your King,

00:55:07.394 --> 00:55:11.297
treason shall never
go unpunished.

00:55:11.331 --> 00:55:13.398
Ser Ilyn,

00:55:13.433 --> 00:55:15.033
bring me his head!

00:55:15.067 --> 00:55:17.235
No! Stop!

00:55:17.269 --> 00:55:19.371
Daddy!
Someone stop him!

00:55:30.516 --> 00:55:32.551
My son, this is madness.

00:55:33.386 --> 00:55:36.321
Put him down!

00:55:41.995 --> 00:55:43.729
- Don't look!
- Let me go.

00:55:43.764 --> 00:55:46.732
- Let me go!
- Shut your mouth. Look at me.

00:55:46.766 --> 00:55:49.535
- Look at me!
- Stop! Daddy!

00:55:49.569 --> 00:55:51.637
- Stop! No no!
- Crowd: Traitor!

00:55:51.671 --> 00:55:53.205
Stop!

00:55:56.676 --> 00:55:58.609
Stop him, stop!

00:56:44.348 --> 00:56:48.348
