WEBVTT

00:00:00.645 --> 00:00:01.745
Tell me what do you want.

00:00:01.757 --> 00:00:03.826
I want you
to serve the realm!

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:05.939
Tell your son
to lay down his sword

00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:08.709
and proclaim Joffrey
as the true heir.

00:00:08.743 --> 00:00:11.045
You think my life is
some precious thing to me?

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.481
What of your
daughter's life, My Lord?

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:15.550
Is that a precious
thing to you?

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:18.420
It's your brother Robb.
He's heading south to war.

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:20.954
I may be a bastard,
but he is my father

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.279
and Robb is my brother.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.495
I will not tell you
to stay or go.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.730
You must make
that choice yourself.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.066
He will die tonight,
Khaleesi.

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.413
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings

00:00:42.447 --> 00:00:43.948
will be in the vanguard.

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:45.783
The tribesmen
on the front lines?

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:47.652
Surely there are ways
to have me killed

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:49.587
that would be less detrimental
to the war effort.

00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:51.255
You must save him.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.991
There is a spell.
There is a price.

00:00:54.026 --> 00:00:56.260
Only death pays for life.

00:00:56.295 --> 00:00:58.730
Khaleesi!

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.469
The witch--
she can bring baby.

00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:06.071
I hear her say so.

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:08.073
- Tribesmen: Half man!
- To battle!

00:01:08.108 --> 00:01:10.442
Oh no!

00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:15.114
- You're wounded.
- I hear we won.

00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:17.583
There were 2,000
Stark bannermen, not 20,000.

00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:19.685
Did we get the Stark boy,
at least?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.821
- He wasn't here.
- Where was he?

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:24.491
With his other
18,000 men.

00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:26.064
By the time they
knew what was happening,

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:27.160
it had already happened.

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:28.294
Kill him, Robb.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.397
He's more use
to us alive than dead.

00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:33.534
Give me my daughters back.
Give me my husband.

00:01:33.568 --> 00:01:36.204
I come before you
to confess my treason.

00:01:36.238 --> 00:01:37.906
Joffrey Baratheon

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.174
is the one true heir
to the Iron Throne.

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.077
My mother wishes me to let
Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:46.181
And My Lady Sansa has begged
mercy for her father.

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:48.150
But they have
the soft hearts of women.

00:01:48.184 --> 00:01:49.918
So long
as I am your King,

00:01:49.953 --> 00:01:52.654
treason shall never
go unpunished.

00:01:52.688 --> 00:01:53.922
Bring me his head!

00:01:53.956 --> 00:01:56.091
- No no no!
- Stop this.

00:04:07.843 --> 00:04:10.111
Look at me.
Look at me!

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:13.314
Do you remember
me now, boy, eh?

00:04:13.348 --> 00:04:16.083
Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:19.753
You'll be coming
with me, boy,

00:04:19.788 --> 00:04:22.789
and you'll be keeping
your mouth shut.

00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:42.241
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!

00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:45.411
You're not a smart boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:48.181
Do you want
to live, boy?!

00:04:50.585 --> 00:04:53.187
North, boy,
we're going north.

00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:28.556
It had three eyes.

00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:31.292
It told me to come
with him, so I did.

00:05:31.326 --> 00:05:35.061
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

00:05:35.096 --> 00:05:37.931
Your father's not
down there, little lord.

00:05:37.965 --> 00:05:40.233
Not for many years yet.

00:05:41.935 --> 00:05:44.603
You're afraid--
just like Hodor.

00:05:44.638 --> 00:05:46.772
I'm not afraid of some hole
in the ground.

00:05:46.807 --> 00:05:50.043
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?

00:05:50.077 --> 00:05:53.213
I'm a crippled boy
and I'm willing to go.

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:01.353
That's my grandfather
Lord Rickard.

00:06:01.388 --> 00:06:04.690
He was burned alive
by the Mad King Aerys.

00:06:06.294 --> 00:06:08.128
That's Lyanna,
my father's sister.

00:06:08.162 --> 00:06:11.064
King Robert was
supposed to marry her,

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.168
but Rhaegar Targaryen
kidnapped her.

00:06:14.202 --> 00:06:16.670
Robert started a war
to win her back.

00:06:16.705 --> 00:06:19.874
He killed Rhaegar,
but she died anyway.

00:06:21.276 --> 00:06:23.444
That's where
I saw father.

00:06:24.912 --> 00:06:28.314
You see?
He's not here.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.958
-Here, Shaggydog.
-Rickon!

00:06:38.993 --> 00:06:40.893
That beast

00:06:40.928 --> 00:06:43.329
is supposed to be
chained in the kennels!

00:06:43.364 --> 00:06:46.566
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.936
- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see father.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.605
How many times have I told you?
He's in King's Landing

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.808
with Sansa and Arya.

00:06:54.842 --> 00:06:57.244
He was down here.
I saw him.

00:06:57.278 --> 00:06:59.012
Saw him when?

00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:00.847
Last night,

00:07:00.881 --> 00:07:03.516
when I was sleeping.

00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:06.051
Here, Shaggydog.

00:07:10.823 --> 00:07:12.924
You both miss him.

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.960
It's only natural
he should be in your thoughts

00:07:15.995 --> 00:07:19.797
and dreams,
but that doesn't mean that--

00:07:19.832 --> 00:07:22.601
Bran...

00:07:39.988 --> 00:07:42.089
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

00:07:42.123 --> 00:07:43.924
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.426
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

00:07:47.828 --> 00:07:49.562
My Lady.

00:08:37.178 --> 00:08:38.845
Robb.

00:08:40.815 --> 00:08:42.115
Robb.

00:08:45.853 --> 00:08:48.054
Robb!

00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:54.427
You've ruined your sword.

00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:06.339
Shh shh.

00:09:06.373 --> 00:09:09.108
- Shh.
- I'll kill them all--

00:09:09.143 --> 00:09:12.645
--Every one of them.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.915
I will kill them all.

00:09:17.885 --> 00:09:20.320
My boy.

00:09:21.989 --> 00:09:24.890
They have your sisters.

00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:28.227
We have to get
the girls back.

00:09:30.197 --> 00:09:32.999

kill them all.

Isn't it a funny song?

00:10:48.746 --> 00:10:50.647
Thank you
for your rendition.

00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:53.649
I imagine it was even better
received at that tavern.

00:10:53.684 --> 00:10:55.718
I'm so sorry,
Your Grace.

00:10:55.752 --> 00:10:57.719
I'll never sing it again,
I swear.

00:10:57.754 --> 00:10:59.888
Tell me,
which do you favor:

00:10:59.922 --> 00:11:02.624
Your fingers
or your tongue?

00:11:02.659 --> 00:11:04.326
Your Grace?

00:11:04.361 --> 00:11:06.262
Fingers
or your tongue?

00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:09.432
If you got to keep one,
which would it be?

00:11:09.466 --> 00:11:12.135
I-- I--

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:14.404
Or I could just
cut your throat.

00:11:15.907 --> 00:11:18.241
Every man needs hands,
Your Grace.

00:11:18.276 --> 00:11:19.843
Good.

00:11:19.877 --> 00:11:22.712
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

00:11:22.747 --> 00:11:24.814
I won't sing--
Your Grace.

00:11:24.849 --> 00:11:26.983
Ser Ilyn,
who better than you

00:11:27.017 --> 00:11:29.119
- to carry out the sentence?
- I beg you!

00:11:29.153 --> 00:11:30.654
Please no.

00:11:32.457 --> 00:11:34.057
No!

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.195
Your Grace, please.
I beg you, I will never sing again!

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.131
- I'm done for the day.
- No-oooo!

00:11:41.165 --> 00:11:43.777
I'll leave the rest
of the matters to you, mother.

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:49.607
Your Grace, please!

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.884
You look quite nice.

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.653
Thank you, My Lord.

00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:03.155
"Your Grace."
I'm King now.

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:06.592
Stop-ppp!
No!

00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:09.394
Walk with me.
I want to show you something.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:16.501
Do as you're bid, child.

00:12:23.009 --> 00:12:25.777
...And as soon as you've had
your blood, I'll put a son in you.

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:28.581
Mother says that
shouldn't be long.

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.754
No, please no!

00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:36.622
This one's your father.

00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.859
This one here.

00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:42.328
Look at it and see
what happens to traitors.

00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:46.365
- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.668
I gave him
a clean death.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.370
Look at him.

00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:54.706
Please let me go home.
I won't do any treason, I swear.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.276
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.979
and obey.

00:13:01.013 --> 00:13:03.314
Look at him!

00:13:11.825 --> 00:13:13.559
Well?

00:13:13.593 --> 00:13:16.496
How long
do I have to look?

00:13:18.332 --> 00:13:20.734
As long as it pleases me.

00:13:23.271 --> 00:13:24.872
Do you want
to see the rest?

00:13:24.906 --> 00:13:27.141
If it please Your Grace.

00:13:27.175 --> 00:13:29.477
That's your Septa there.

00:13:31.413 --> 00:13:32.780
I'll tell you what:

00:13:32.814 --> 00:13:35.149
I'm going to give you
a present.

00:13:35.183 --> 00:13:38.953
After I raise my armies
and kill your traitor brother,

00:13:38.987 --> 00:13:41.455
I'm going to give you
his head as well.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.191
Or maybe he'll
give me yours.

00:13:49.798 --> 00:13:52.865
My mother tells me a King
should never strike his lady.

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:55.802
Ser Meryn.

00:14:17.324 --> 00:14:19.658
Here, girl.

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:25.063
Will you obey now?

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:27.632
Or do you need
another lesson?

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.372
I'll look for you
in court.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.477
Save yourself
some pain, girl.

00:14:38.511 --> 00:14:40.479
Give him what he wants.

00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:44.249
You'll be
needing that again.

00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:07.707
The proper course
is clear:

00:15:07.742 --> 00:15:10.177
Pledge fealty to King Renly
and move south

00:15:10.211 --> 00:15:12.246
to join our forces
with his.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.015
Renly is not the King.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.285
You cannot mean
to hold to Joffrey, My Lord.

00:15:18.319 --> 00:15:20.120
He put your father
to death.

00:15:20.154 --> 00:15:22.055
That doesn't
make Renly King.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.825
He's Robert's
youngest brother.

00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:27.961
If Bran can't be Lord
of Winterfell before me,

00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:29.963
Renly can't be King
before Stannis.

00:15:29.997 --> 00:15:32.065
Do you mean to declare us
for Stannis?

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:33.948
- Renly is not right!
- My Lords.

00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:35.718
If we put ourselves
behind Stannis--

00:15:35.743 --> 00:15:36.943
My Lords!

00:15:37.838 --> 00:15:40.940
Here is what I say
to these two Kings--

00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:46.612
Renly Baratheon
is nothing to me,

00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:49.015
nor Stannis neither.

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:51.584
Why should they rule
over me and mine

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.753
from some flowery seat
in the South?

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:57.990
What do they know of the Wall
or the Wolfswood?

00:15:58.892 --> 00:16:00.993
Even their Gods
are wrong!

00:16:04.998 --> 00:16:07.333
Why shouldn't we rule
ourselves again?

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:10.503
It was the Dragons
we bowed to

00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:13.606
and now the Dragons
are dead!

00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:17.944
There sits the only King

00:16:17.978 --> 00:16:21.214
I mean to bend
my knee to--

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:23.649
the King
in the North!

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.092
I'll have peace
on those terms.

00:16:33.127 --> 00:16:35.796
They can keep
their Red Castle

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.699
and their Iron Chair too.

00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:41.702
The King
in the North!

00:16:43.538 --> 00:16:46.607
Am I your brother,
now and always?

00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:48.242
Now and always.

00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:54.917
My sword is yours,
in victory and defeat

00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:58.054
from this day
until my last day.

00:16:59.222 --> 00:17:00.656
The King
in the North!

00:17:00.691 --> 00:17:04.594
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:07.130
The King
in the North!

00:17:07.164 --> 00:17:10.032
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

00:17:10.066 --> 00:17:12.133
The King
in the North!

00:17:12.168 --> 00:17:14.268
The King in the North!

00:17:14.303 --> 00:17:16.404
The King
in the North!

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:18.072
The King in the North!

00:17:18.107 --> 00:17:24.078
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

00:17:28.217 --> 00:17:30.952
- Lady Stark.
- I want to see him.

00:17:31.954 --> 00:17:33.654
Now!

00:17:53.709 --> 00:17:55.276
Leave us.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.785
You look lovely
tonight, Lady Stark.

00:18:03.819 --> 00:18:06.220
Widowhood becomes you.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.991
Your bed must be lonely.

00:18:11.026 --> 00:18:12.793
Is that why you came?

00:18:12.828 --> 00:18:15.429
I'm not at my best,

00:18:15.463 --> 00:18:17.665
but I think I could
be of service.

00:18:17.699 --> 00:18:21.535
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if I'm up to it.

00:18:25.873 --> 00:18:29.042
Oh, I do like
a violent woman.

00:18:29.076 --> 00:18:32.012
I will kill you
tonight, Ser,

00:18:32.047 --> 00:18:35.850
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

00:18:35.884 --> 00:18:37.385
Let me show you how--

00:18:37.419 --> 00:18:39.921
hit me again,
over the ear.

00:18:39.955 --> 00:18:41.889
And again and again.

00:18:41.924 --> 00:18:44.926
You're stronger than you look--
it shouldn't take long.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.894
That is what you want
the world to believe,

00:18:46.929 --> 00:18:48.763
isn't it?
That you don't fear death.

00:18:48.797 --> 00:18:50.631
But I don't, My Lady.

00:18:50.665 --> 00:18:54.201
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

00:18:54.235 --> 00:18:56.803
Because you are going
to the deepest

00:18:56.838 --> 00:18:59.239
of the Seven Hells,
if the Gods are just.

00:18:59.273 --> 00:19:01.441
What Gods are those?

00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:04.177
The trees your husband
prayed to?

00:19:05.847 --> 00:19:08.782
Where were the trees when his
head was getting chopped off?

00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:11.752
If your Gods are real
and if they are just,

00:19:11.786 --> 00:19:14.921
why is the world
so full of injustice?

00:19:16.223 --> 00:19:19.192
Because of men like you.

00:19:19.227 --> 00:19:21.862
There are no men like me.

00:19:22.764 --> 00:19:24.865
Only me.

00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:32.374
My son Bran.

00:19:33.576 --> 00:19:35.977
How did he come to fall
from that tower?

00:19:36.012 --> 00:19:38.580
I pushed him
out the window.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.584
Why?

00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:47.056
I hoped the fall
would kill him.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.124
Why?

00:19:56.932 --> 00:19:58.867
You should get some sleep.

00:19:58.901 --> 00:20:01.303
It's going to be
a long war.

00:20:25.731 --> 00:20:28.665
I can't believe
we're actually at war.

00:20:30.135 --> 00:20:32.970
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

00:20:36.475 --> 00:20:38.776
What does it say?

00:20:39.845 --> 00:20:41.912
Have we captured
Robb Stark yet?

00:20:41.947 --> 00:20:44.848
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

00:20:46.117 --> 00:20:48.085
Get back into bed.

00:20:55.926 --> 00:20:58.060
They have my son.

00:21:01.064 --> 00:21:03.799
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

00:21:03.834 --> 00:21:07.103
I've heard his wolf killed a doze
men and as many horses.

00:21:07.137 --> 00:21:08.904
Is it true about
Stannis and Renly?

00:21:08.939 --> 00:21:11.707
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

00:21:11.742 --> 00:21:14.310
Jaime captured,
his armies scattered...

00:21:14.344 --> 00:21:16.245
It's a catastrophe.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.281
Perhaps we should
sue for peace.

00:21:22.619 --> 00:21:24.888
There's your peace.

00:21:24.922 --> 00:21:28.891
Joffrey saw to that when he
decided to remove Ned Stark's head.

00:21:28.926 --> 00:21:32.362
You'll have an easier time
drinking from that cup

00:21:32.396 --> 00:21:35.699
than you will bringing Robb Stark
to the table now.

00:21:35.733 --> 00:21:37.234
He's winning...

00:21:37.268 --> 00:21:39.236
in case you
hadn't noticed.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.771
I'm told we still
have his sisters.

00:21:40.805 --> 00:21:43.440
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

00:21:43.475 --> 00:21:45.343
No truces.
We can't afford to look weak.

00:21:45.377 --> 00:21:46.978
We should march
on them at once.

00:21:47.012 --> 00:21:49.614
First we must return
to Casterly Rock to raise--

00:21:49.648 --> 00:21:52.116
They have my son!

00:21:54.753 --> 00:21:56.855
Get out, all of you.

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:09.568
Not you.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.353
You were right
about Eddard Stark.

00:22:29.155 --> 00:22:31.189
If he were alive,
we could have used him

00:22:31.223 --> 00:22:34.492
to broker a peace
with Winterfell and Riverrun,

00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:36.861
which would have
given us more time

00:22:36.895 --> 00:22:39.731
to deal with Robert's brothers.
But now...

00:22:40.967 --> 00:22:44.002
Madness--
madness and stupidity.

00:22:46.873 --> 00:22:50.009
I always thought
you were a stunted fool.

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:53.312
Perhaps I was wrong.

00:22:53.314 --> 00:22:55.616
Half wrong.

00:22:57.051 --> 00:22:59.387
I'm new to strategy, but--

00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:01.655
unless we want to be
surrounded by three armies,

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.724
it appears we can't
stay here.

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:05.659
No one will stay here.

00:23:05.693 --> 00:23:09.128
Ser Gregor will head out
with 500 riders

00:23:09.163 --> 00:23:13.066
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.569
The rest of us will
regroup at Harrenhal.

00:23:18.672 --> 00:23:20.807
And you will go
to King's Landing.

00:23:20.841 --> 00:23:23.042
And do what?

00:23:23.077 --> 00:23:24.978
Rule!

00:23:25.012 --> 00:23:27.880
You will serve as Hand
of the King in my stead.

00:23:27.914 --> 00:23:31.950
You will bring that boy King to heel
and his mother too, if needs be.

00:23:31.984 --> 00:23:35.654
And if you get so much as a whiff
of treason from any of the rest:

00:23:35.689 --> 00:23:38.724
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle--
- Heads, spikes, walls.

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:41.961
Why not my Uncle?

00:23:41.995 --> 00:23:44.563
Why not anyone?
Why me?

00:23:44.598 --> 00:23:47.166
You're my son.

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:56.676
Oh, one more thing:

00:23:56.711 --> 00:24:00.113
You will not take
the whore to court.

00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:02.081
Do you understand?

00:24:21.334 --> 00:24:23.969
Ser Jorah?

00:24:27.373 --> 00:24:30.542
Gently gently.

00:24:32.277 --> 00:24:34.011
My son...

00:24:34.045 --> 00:24:36.547
Where is he?
I want him.

00:24:39.183 --> 00:24:40.951
Where is he?

00:24:43.055 --> 00:24:45.289
The boy did not live.

00:24:52.332 --> 00:24:55.100
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

00:24:55.135 --> 00:24:57.536
How did my son die?!

00:24:58.972 --> 00:25:02.041
He never lived,
My Princess.

00:25:02.076 --> 00:25:04.143
The women say...

00:25:04.178 --> 00:25:05.945
What do the women say?

00:25:08.515 --> 00:25:11.818
- They say the child was--
- Monstrous,

00:25:11.852 --> 00:25:13.486
twisted.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.521
I pulled him out
myself.

00:25:16.957 --> 00:25:19.425
He was scaled
like a lizard,

00:25:19.459 --> 00:25:23.829
blind, with leather wings
like the wings of a bat.

00:25:23.864 --> 00:25:27.099
When I touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

00:25:27.133 --> 00:25:31.070
Inside he was
full of graveworms.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:37.844
I warned you that only death
can pay for life.

00:25:37.878 --> 00:25:40.013
You knew the price.

00:25:40.047 --> 00:25:42.983
Where is Khal Drogo?

00:25:43.017 --> 00:25:45.118
Show him to me.

00:25:45.152 --> 00:25:47.687
Show me what I bought

00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:50.623
with my son's life.

00:25:50.657 --> 00:25:52.725
As you command, lady.

00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:54.426
Come.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.261
I will take you
to him.

00:25:56.295 --> 00:25:59.230
- Time enough for that later--
- I want to see him now.

00:26:14.949 --> 00:26:17.184
The Khalasar is gone.

00:26:17.218 --> 00:26:19.820
A Khal who cannot ride
is no Khal.

00:26:19.855 --> 00:26:22.690
The Dothraki
follow only the strong.

00:26:22.724 --> 00:26:25.392
I'm sorry, My Princess.

00:26:37.239 --> 00:26:38.339
Drogo!

00:26:42.477 --> 00:26:44.378
Why is he out here alone?

00:26:44.413 --> 00:26:47.181
He seems to like
the warmth, Princess.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.154
He lives.

00:26:53.188 --> 00:26:55.990
You asked for life,
you paid for life.

00:26:56.024 --> 00:26:59.626
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:02.029
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east

00:27:02.064 --> 00:27:04.098
when the seas go dry.

00:27:04.132 --> 00:27:07.902
When the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

00:27:23.053 --> 00:27:24.754
Leave us.

00:27:26.256 --> 00:27:28.491
I don't want you alone
with this sorceress.

00:27:28.526 --> 00:27:31.728
I have nothing more
to fear from this woman.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.230
Go.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.406
You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.308
It was wrong of them
to burn my temple.

00:27:46.343 --> 00:27:50.279
- It angered the Great Shepherd.
- This is not God's work.

00:27:50.313 --> 00:27:52.948
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

00:27:52.982 --> 00:27:56.251
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

00:27:56.285 --> 00:27:57.730
Now he will burn no cities.

00:27:57.755 --> 00:28:00.306
Now his Khalasar will trample
no nations into dust.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:03.025
I spoke for you.

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:05.261
I saved you.

00:28:05.295 --> 00:28:07.896
Saved me?

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.031
Three of those riders
had already

00:28:10.066 --> 00:28:12.801
raped me before
you saved me, girl.

00:28:15.905 --> 00:28:18.507
I saw my God's house burn,

00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:22.911
there where I had healed men
and women beyond counting.

00:28:22.945 --> 00:28:25.613
In the streets
I saw piles of heads--

00:28:25.648 --> 00:28:28.183
the head of the Baker
who makes my bread,

00:28:28.217 --> 00:28:29.617
the head of a young boy

00:28:29.652 --> 00:28:32.487
that I had cured of fever
just three moons past.

00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:36.491
So tell me again
exactly what it was

00:28:36.525 --> 00:28:37.893
that you saved.

00:28:37.927 --> 00:28:39.861
Your life.

00:28:39.895 --> 00:28:41.896
Hmph.

00:28:41.931 --> 00:28:44.532
Why don't you take
a look at your Khal...

00:28:46.302 --> 00:28:49.137
Then you will see
exactly what life is worth

00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:51.973
when all the rest has gone.

00:29:04.653 --> 00:29:06.888
You can't!

00:29:06.922 --> 00:29:09.124
Get out of my way, Sam.

00:29:09.158 --> 00:29:11.459
They'll put out the word.

00:29:11.494 --> 00:29:14.396
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.266
Do you know what happens
to deserters?

00:29:20.169 --> 00:29:21.870
Better than you do.

00:29:21.904 --> 00:29:24.573
What are you going to do?

00:29:24.607 --> 00:29:26.508
I'm gonna find my brother

00:29:26.543 --> 00:29:29.578
and put a sword through
King Joffrey's throat.

00:29:30.747 --> 00:29:33.883
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

00:29:33.917 --> 00:29:37.920
- Move.
- I won't let you go.

00:29:37.954 --> 00:29:40.856
- Move.
- No.

00:29:41.725 --> 00:29:43.592
Hyah!

00:29:58.444 --> 00:30:01.246
Hand of the King?

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.281
So it would seem.

00:30:03.315 --> 00:30:07.819
And your father said you couldn't take
anyone with you to King's Landing.

00:30:07.853 --> 00:30:10.789
No, he said I couldn't take you
with me to King's Landing.

00:30:10.823 --> 00:30:12.491
He was very specific
on that point.

00:30:12.525 --> 00:30:14.526
He knew my name?

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.294
What?

00:30:16.328 --> 00:30:18.896
He said, "Don't bring Shae
with you to King's Landing"?

00:30:18.931 --> 00:30:22.032
I believe he used
the word "whore."

00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:25.168
Are you ashamed of me?

00:30:25.203 --> 00:30:28.238
Are you afraid that I'm dancing
around the court with my tits out?

00:30:28.272 --> 00:30:31.374
I'm funny now?

00:30:31.409 --> 00:30:33.610
I'm Shae the funny whore.

00:30:35.079 --> 00:30:38.081
My father's probably the most
powerful man in the country.

00:30:38.115 --> 00:30:39.382
Certainly the richest.

00:30:39.417 --> 00:30:42.018
He has all Seven Kingdoms
in his pockets.

00:30:42.052 --> 00:30:43.853
Everyone everywhere

00:30:43.887 --> 00:30:47.023
always has to do exactly
what my father says.

00:30:48.492 --> 00:30:50.460
He's always been a cunt.

00:30:57.402 --> 00:30:59.069
I believe the ladies
of the court

00:30:59.104 --> 00:31:02.206
could learn a great deal
from a girl like you.

00:31:04.443 --> 00:31:06.177
Why don't you
come with me,

00:31:06.211 --> 00:31:08.946
be the Hand's lady?

00:31:10.482 --> 00:31:13.150
Because the King needs
a Hand and the Hand--

00:31:17.522 --> 00:31:20.258
I know what
a Hand needs.

00:31:33.272 --> 00:31:35.207
- Ghost?
- Hyah!

00:31:35.241 --> 00:31:38.110
- Hyah.
- Hyah!

00:31:41.515 --> 00:31:43.149
Hyah.

00:31:45.786 --> 00:31:48.688
Samwell!

00:31:49.957 --> 00:31:52.592
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.

00:31:52.626 --> 00:31:54.194
Did we get him?

00:31:54.228 --> 00:31:56.329
Come on, help me
get him up.

00:31:58.633 --> 00:32:01.868
Lucky you've got
plenty of padding.

00:32:03.738 --> 00:32:05.739
We're taking you back
to where you belong.

00:32:05.773 --> 00:32:08.375
- I belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

00:32:08.409 --> 00:32:10.677
They'll kill you if they find out
you've gone.

00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:12.812
They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.

00:32:12.847 --> 00:32:15.849
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

00:32:15.883 --> 00:32:18.752
- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.

00:32:18.786 --> 00:32:21.021
You took the oath.
You can't leave.

00:32:21.055 --> 00:32:23.190
- I have to.
- You can't.

00:32:23.224 --> 00:32:25.726
- You said the words.
- I don't care about--

00:32:25.761 --> 00:32:28.896
"Hear my words and bear
witness to my vow..."

00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:30.868
To hell with all of you.

00:32:30.893 --> 00:32:33.215
"Night gathers and now
my Watch begins.

00:32:33.369 --> 00:32:36.705
It shall not end
until my death.

00:32:36.739 --> 00:32:38.506
I shall live and die
at my post."

00:32:38.541 --> 00:32:40.442
"I am the sword
in the darkness..."

00:32:40.476 --> 00:32:42.510
"...The Watcher on the Walls,

00:32:42.545 --> 00:32:44.947
the shield that guards
the realms of men.

00:32:44.981 --> 00:32:48.684
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch,

00:32:48.718 --> 00:32:52.821
for this night
and all nights to come."

00:34:35.892 --> 00:34:39.061
When the sun

00:34:39.096 --> 00:34:41.497
rises in the west

00:34:41.532 --> 00:34:44.967
and sets in the east...

00:34:47.604 --> 00:34:51.673
Then you shall return
to me, my sun and stars.

00:35:58.908 --> 00:36:01.343
Kings?

00:36:01.377 --> 00:36:05.447
Oh, I can tell you all
there is to know about Kings.

00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:10.619
The thing you need to
understand about Kings is...

00:36:15.292 --> 00:36:19.195
For the past 67 years,
I've known--

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:24.301
truly known more Kings
than any man alive.

00:36:25.804 --> 00:36:30.373
They're complicated men,
but I know how to serve them.

00:36:30.408 --> 00:36:32.309
Yes.

00:36:32.343 --> 00:36:34.945
And keep on serving them.

00:36:37.215 --> 00:36:39.951
Aerys Targaryen...

00:36:39.985 --> 00:36:45.456
of all the thousand thousand
maladies the Gods visit on us,

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:49.192
madness is the worst.

00:36:50.127 --> 00:36:52.128
He was a good man,

00:36:52.162 --> 00:36:55.331
such a charmer.

00:36:56.433 --> 00:36:59.502
To watch him melt away
before my eyes,

00:36:59.536 --> 00:37:01.570
consumed by dreams

00:37:01.605 --> 00:37:04.773
of fire and blood...

00:37:07.477 --> 00:37:09.779
Robert Baratheon

00:37:09.813 --> 00:37:12.748
was an entirely different animal--
powerful man,

00:37:12.783 --> 00:37:14.918
a great warrior--

00:37:14.952 --> 00:37:17.921
but alas,
winning a Kingdom

00:37:17.955 --> 00:37:21.892
and ruling a Kingdom
are rather different things.

00:37:21.926 --> 00:37:24.227
They say that

00:37:24.295 --> 00:37:27.697
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

00:37:27.731 --> 00:37:30.032
he can often be blind

00:37:30.066 --> 00:37:32.902
to the enemies at his side.

00:37:34.837 --> 00:37:38.540
Now I serve his son

00:37:38.574 --> 00:37:40.808
King Joffrey,

00:37:40.843 --> 00:37:43.044
may the Gods
bless his reign.

00:37:44.414 --> 00:37:48.117
He is a capable young man--
strong military mind.

00:37:48.151 --> 00:37:51.387
Stern...

00:37:51.421 --> 00:37:55.392
But sternness in defense
of the realm is no vice.

00:37:56.861 --> 00:38:00.063
It's far too soon to know what
manner of King he will be,

00:38:00.098 --> 00:38:01.698
but I sense

00:38:01.733 --> 00:38:06.769
true greatness on the horizon
for our new King.

00:38:08.839 --> 00:38:11.240
True greatness.

00:38:15.479 --> 00:38:17.612
So what's the thing?

00:38:19.382 --> 00:38:21.082
What thing?

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.784
About Kings.

00:38:22.819 --> 00:38:25.954
You said, "the thing you need
to understand about Kings..."

00:38:26.822 --> 00:38:28.723
What? Things?
What?

00:38:28.757 --> 00:38:31.559
When you started, you--
never mind.

00:38:33.194 --> 00:38:35.629
Let me see you
out, my dear.

00:38:35.663 --> 00:38:38.566
- It's all right. No need.
- Yes yes.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.034
Till the next time.

00:39:00.954 --> 00:39:02.922
Right.

00:39:28.883 --> 00:39:32.352
When you imagine yourself up
there, how do you look?

00:39:32.387 --> 00:39:36.557
Does the crown fit?
Do all the lords and ladies

00:39:36.591 --> 00:39:40.427
simper and bow, the ones who
sneered at you for years?

00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:43.763
It's hard for them to simper
and bow without heads.

00:39:45.065 --> 00:39:47.567
A man with great ambition
and no morals--

00:39:47.602 --> 00:39:49.969
I wouldn't
bet against you.

00:39:50.004 --> 00:39:51.805
And what would you do,
my friend,

00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:54.207
if you found yourself
sitting up there?

00:39:56.143 --> 00:39:58.110
I must be one of the few men
in this city

00:39:58.145 --> 00:39:59.779
who doesn't
want to be King.

00:39:59.813 --> 00:40:01.848
You must be one
of the few men in the city

00:40:01.882 --> 00:40:03.216
who isn't a man.

00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:05.119
Oh, you can do
better than that.

00:40:09.457 --> 00:40:12.759
When they castrated you, did they
take the pillar with the stones?

00:40:12.794 --> 00:40:14.728
- I've always wondered.
- Have you?

00:40:14.762 --> 00:40:17.765
Do you spend a lot of time wondering
what's between my legs?

00:40:17.799 --> 00:40:20.901
I picture a gash

00:40:20.935 --> 00:40:23.370
like a woman's.
Is that about right?

00:40:23.404 --> 00:40:26.239
I am flattered, of course,
to be pictured at all.

00:40:26.273 --> 00:40:29.842
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years--

00:40:29.877 --> 00:40:32.912
a man from another land,

00:40:32.946 --> 00:40:35.614
despised by most,

00:40:35.649 --> 00:40:37.082
feared by all--

00:40:37.117 --> 00:40:38.684
am I?
That is good to know.

00:40:38.718 --> 00:40:41.987
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

00:40:42.021 --> 00:40:45.924
But you carry on,
whispering in one King's ear

00:40:45.958 --> 00:40:48.560
and then the next.

00:40:50.663 --> 00:40:52.531
I admire you.

00:40:52.566 --> 00:40:55.234
And I admire you,
Lord Baelish.

00:40:55.268 --> 00:40:58.271
A grasper from a minor house
with a major talent

00:40:58.305 --> 00:41:00.440
for befriending
powerful men--

00:41:00.474 --> 00:41:01.571
and women.

00:41:01.596 --> 00:41:03.322
A useful talent,
I'm sure you'd agree.

00:41:06.046 --> 00:41:09.415
So here we stand...

00:41:09.449 --> 00:41:12.651
In mutual admiration
and respect.

00:41:12.686 --> 00:41:14.853
Playing our roles.

00:41:14.888 --> 00:41:16.755
Serving a new King.

00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:18.724
Long may he reign.

00:41:18.758 --> 00:41:20.993
- My King.
- My King.

00:41:22.395 --> 00:41:25.364
My Lords.
Shall we begin?

00:41:26.433 --> 00:41:28.401
You're Arry now, hear me?

00:41:28.435 --> 00:41:30.670
Arry the orphan boy.

00:41:30.704 --> 00:41:32.972
No one asks an orphan
too many questions

00:41:33.006 --> 00:41:35.208
'cause nobody gives
three shits.

00:41:35.243 --> 00:41:36.543
What's your name?

00:41:36.577 --> 00:41:38.345
- Arry.
- Ah.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:41.949
We have a long way
to travel and in bad company.

00:41:41.983 --> 00:41:44.151
I have 20 this time,

00:41:44.185 --> 00:41:46.253
men and boys all
bound for the Wall.

00:41:46.287 --> 00:41:49.990
Your Lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons

00:41:50.024 --> 00:41:53.159
and I didn't find
no little lordlings down there.

00:41:53.194 --> 00:41:56.430
This lot, half of them would
turn you over to the King

00:41:56.464 --> 00:41:58.565
quick as spit for a pardon.

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:00.634
And the other half
would do the same,

00:42:00.668 --> 00:42:02.870
except they'd
rape you first.

00:42:02.904 --> 00:42:05.205
So keep to yourself--
and when you piss,

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.407
do it in the woods alone.

00:42:09.043 --> 00:42:11.110
You stay
with this lot, boy.

00:42:11.145 --> 00:42:12.745
And stay--

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.616
or I'll lock you in the back of
the wagon with these three.

00:42:20.487 --> 00:42:22.288
Watch yourself,
midget.

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:25.558
He's got a sword,
this one.

00:42:25.593 --> 00:42:28.095
What's a gutter rat
like you doing with a sword?

00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:31.332
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

00:42:31.366 --> 00:42:32.967
He looks like a girl.

00:42:33.001 --> 00:42:35.202
I bet he stole
that sword.

00:42:35.237 --> 00:42:37.871
Let's have a look.

00:42:40.241 --> 00:42:42.142
I could use me
a sword like that.

00:42:42.177 --> 00:42:44.411
- Take it off him.
- Give it here, midget.

00:42:44.445 --> 00:42:45.612
Look at him!

00:42:45.647 --> 00:42:47.747
You'd better give
Hot Pie the sword.

00:42:47.782 --> 00:42:49.483
I've seen him
kick a boy to death.

00:42:49.517 --> 00:42:51.885
I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls

00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:54.287
and I kept kicking him
until he was dead.

00:42:54.322 --> 00:42:57.757
I kicked him
all to pieces.

00:42:57.791 --> 00:43:00.827
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

00:43:00.861 --> 00:43:02.695
I'll give it to you.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.432
I already killed
one fat boy.

00:43:05.466 --> 00:43:07.700
I bet you never
killed anyone.

00:43:07.735 --> 00:43:10.770
I bet you're a liar.
But I'm not.

00:43:10.805 --> 00:43:12.572
I'm good at killing
fat boys.

00:43:12.606 --> 00:43:14.908
I like killing fat boys.

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.545
Oh, you like picking
on the little ones, do you?

00:43:18.579 --> 00:43:21.415
You know, I've been hammering
an anvil these past 10 years.

00:43:21.449 --> 00:43:24.485
When I hit
that steel, it sings.

00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:26.820
Are you gonna sing
when I hit you?

00:43:33.461 --> 00:43:35.695
This is
castle-forged steel.

00:43:35.729 --> 00:43:37.863
Where'd you steal it?

00:43:37.898 --> 00:43:40.332
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

00:43:40.367 --> 00:43:42.968
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

00:43:43.003 --> 00:43:46.105
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen--

00:43:46.139 --> 00:43:48.207
murderers.

00:43:48.241 --> 00:43:51.744
- Which are you?
- Armorer's apprentice.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.748
But my master
got sick of me,

00:43:55.783 --> 00:43:57.050
so here I am.

00:43:57.084 --> 00:44:00.086
Come on, you sorry
sons of whores!

00:44:00.121 --> 00:44:03.422
It's a thousand leagues
from here to the Wall

00:44:03.456 --> 00:44:06.091
and winter is coming!

00:44:36.623 --> 00:44:38.557
Ham.

00:44:38.592 --> 00:44:41.060
How many days in a row
must a man be

00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:43.697
expected to start
his day with ham?

00:44:43.731 --> 00:44:46.700
Bring me some beer
at least.

00:44:48.736 --> 00:44:50.671
You look exhausted.

00:44:50.705 --> 00:44:52.940
Was your moonlight ride
that tiring?

00:44:56.578 --> 00:44:58.445
Don't look so terrified.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.349
If we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

00:45:01.383 --> 00:45:03.918
only ghosts
would guard the Wall.

00:45:03.952 --> 00:45:07.489
At least you weren't
whoring in Mole's Town.

00:45:08.457 --> 00:45:10.225
Honor made you leave,

00:45:10.259 --> 00:45:12.061
honor brought you back.

00:45:13.029 --> 00:45:15.230
My friends
brought me back.

00:45:15.265 --> 00:45:18.001
I didn't say
it was your honor.

00:45:18.035 --> 00:45:19.970
They killed my father.

00:45:20.004 --> 00:45:22.773
And you're going to bring him
back to life, are you?

00:45:22.807 --> 00:45:25.142
No? Good.

00:45:25.176 --> 00:45:27.978
We've had enough
of that sort of thing.

00:45:29.146 --> 00:45:31.047
Beyond the Wall,
the rangers are

00:45:31.082 --> 00:45:33.549
reporting whole villages
abandoned.

00:45:33.584 --> 00:45:36.953
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

00:45:36.987 --> 00:45:39.054
from dusk until dawn.

00:45:39.088 --> 00:45:43.725
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:47.363
to what ends
the Gods only know.

00:45:47.397 --> 00:45:49.631
Outside Eastwatch

00:45:49.666 --> 00:45:53.035
Cotter Pyke's men discovered four
blue-eyed corpses.

00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:57.472
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

00:45:59.408 --> 00:46:02.544
Do you think
your brother's war

00:46:02.578 --> 00:46:05.079
is more important
than ours?

00:46:06.248 --> 00:46:09.818
- No.
- When dead men and worse

00:46:09.852 --> 00:46:12.754
come hunting for us in the night,
do you think it matters

00:46:12.788 --> 00:46:15.291
who sits
on the Iron Throne?

00:46:15.325 --> 00:46:17.760
- No.
- Good.

00:46:17.794 --> 00:46:20.664
Because I want you
and your wolf with us

00:46:20.698 --> 00:46:23.900
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

00:46:24.902 --> 00:46:27.036
Beyond the Wall?

00:46:27.071 --> 00:46:28.805
I'll not sit meekly by

00:46:28.839 --> 00:46:30.773
and wait for the snows.

00:46:30.808 --> 00:46:33.209
I mean to find out
what's happening.

00:46:33.243 --> 00:46:35.912
The Night's Watch will
ride in force

00:46:35.947 --> 00:46:38.548
against the wildlings,
the White Walkers

00:46:38.583 --> 00:46:40.584
and whatever else
is out there.

00:46:43.255 --> 00:46:45.923
And we will find Benjen Stark,

00:46:45.957 --> 00:46:48.159
alive or dead.

00:46:48.193 --> 00:46:51.429
I will command them
myself.

00:46:51.463 --> 00:46:53.664
So I'll only ask you once,
Lord Snow...

00:46:53.699 --> 00:46:56.334
Move out!

00:46:56.368 --> 00:46:59.037
...Are you a brother
of the Night's Watch

00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:02.874
or a bastard boy
who wants to play at war?

00:47:45.485 --> 00:47:48.920
Drogo will have no use for
dragon eggs in the Night Lands.

00:47:48.955 --> 00:47:52.090
Sell them. You can return
to the Free Cities

00:47:52.124 --> 00:47:54.459
and live as a wealthy woman
for all your days.

00:47:54.494 --> 00:47:56.995
They were not
given to me to sell.

00:48:02.468 --> 00:48:05.036
Khaleesi, My Queen,

00:48:05.071 --> 00:48:08.407
I vow to serve you,
obey you,

00:48:08.441 --> 00:48:10.776
to die for you
if need be,

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:13.579
but let him go,
Khaleesi.

00:48:13.614 --> 00:48:16.382
I know what you intend.
Do not.

00:48:16.417 --> 00:48:19.252
I must.

00:48:19.286 --> 00:48:21.387
You don't understand--

00:48:21.455 --> 00:48:24.924
Don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

00:48:24.958 --> 00:48:27.460
I won't watch you burn.

00:48:29.097 --> 00:48:31.265
Is that what you fear?

00:48:50.184 --> 00:48:52.986
You will be my Khalasar.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.456
I see the faces of slaves.

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:59.125
I free you.

00:48:59.159 --> 00:49:03.863
Take off your collars. Go if you
wish, no one will stop you.

00:49:03.897 --> 00:49:06.366
But if you stay,

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.070
it will be as
brothers and sisters,

00:49:10.138 --> 00:49:13.740
as husbands and wives.

00:49:24.451 --> 00:49:26.986
Ser Jorah, bind this woman
to the pyre.

00:49:29.624 --> 00:49:31.959
You swore to obey me.

00:49:40.904 --> 00:49:43.573
I am Daenerys Stormborn

00:49:43.607 --> 00:49:46.375
of House Targaryen

00:49:46.409 --> 00:49:48.644
of the blood of Old Valyria.

00:49:48.678 --> 00:49:51.280
I am the Dragon's daughter.

00:49:51.314 --> 00:49:53.749
And I swear to you

00:49:53.784 --> 00:49:57.354
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

00:49:57.388 --> 00:49:59.256
You will not
hear me scream.

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:01.324
I will.

00:50:03.295 --> 00:50:05.829
But it is not
your screams I want.

00:50:05.864 --> 00:50:08.366
Only your life.

00:52:38.583 --> 00:52:41.452
Blood of my blood.
