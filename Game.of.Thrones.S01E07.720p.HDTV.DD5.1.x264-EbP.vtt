WEBVTT

00:00:00.664 --> 00:00:02.980
He's attacked one of my
brothers and abducted the other.

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:04.979
Tell your wife to return

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.803
that little shit of an Imp
to King's Landing.

00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:09.595
What about
Jaime Lannister?

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.134
I'm half a kingdom in debt
to his bloody father.

00:00:13.168 --> 00:00:14.863
We'll talk when I return
from the hunt.

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:16.078
The hunt?

00:00:16.103 --> 00:00:18.123
You'll have to sit on
the Throne while I'm away.

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:20.111
You are accused of hiring

00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:22.815
a man to slay my son
Bran in his bed.

00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:24.917
I demand
a trial by combat.

00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:27.821
- You have that right.
- Do I have a volunteer?

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.792
I'll stand for the dwarf.

00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:34.129
Grand Maester Pycelle.
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:37.000
Inform Tywin Lannister that
he has been summoned to court

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:39.436
to answer for the crimes
of Gregor Clegane

00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:41.539
or be branded an enemy
of the Crown

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.574
and a traitor to the realm.

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:46.043
Fight!

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:55.383
I'm sending you both
back to Winterfell.

00:00:55.418 --> 00:00:57.618
What? I'm supposed to marry
Prince Joffrey.

00:00:57.652 --> 00:01:00.220
He'll be the greatest king
that ever was, a golden lion.

00:01:00.254 --> 00:01:03.189
And I'll give him sons
with beautiful blond hair.

00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:05.757
"Lord Orys Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:07.959
"Axel Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:10.395
"Robert Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.933
"Joffrey Baratheon,
golden-haired."

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:17.271
I want what I came for.
I want the crown he promised me.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.177
- No, Dany, please!
- A crown for a king.

00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:27.849
Fire cannot kill a dragon.

Uh, "arrive

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.719
Poor Ned Stark...

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.819
Brave man,
terrible judgment.

00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:56.522
Attacking him was stupid.

00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:06.998
Lannisters

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.801
don't act like fools.

00:04:14.773 --> 00:04:16.774
Are you gonna say
something clever?

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:20.711
Go on,
say something clever.

00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:25.781
Catelyn Stark
took my brother.

00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:32.153
Why is he still alive?

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.056
- Tyrion?
- Ned Stark.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.758
One of our men
interfered,

00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:41.195
speared him through the leg
before I could finish him.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.530
Why is he still alive?

00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:49.236
- It wouldn't have been clean.
- Clean.

00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:51.768
You spend too much time
worrying about

00:04:51.793 --> 00:04:53.221
what other people think of you.

00:04:53.222 --> 00:04:55.644
I could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:58.915
That's what you want
people to think of you.

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.917
It's the truth.

00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:02.838
When you hear them
whispering

00:05:02.863 --> 00:05:04.063
"Kingslayer"
behind your back--

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:06.257
doesn't it bother you?

00:05:08.193 --> 00:05:10.527
Of course
it bothers me.

00:05:10.562 --> 00:05:12.529
The lion doesn't
concern himself

00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:14.697
with the opinions
of the sheep.

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:20.001
I suppose I should be grateful
that your vanity

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:23.037
got in the way
of your recklessness.

00:05:24.706 --> 00:05:27.174
I'm giving you
half of our forces--

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.511
30,000 men.

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:32.347
You will bring them to
Catelyn Stark's girlhood home

00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:35.184
and remind her
that Lannisters

00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:37.052
pay their debts.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:41.357
I didn't realize you placed such
a high value on my brother's life.

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:43.727
He's a Lannister.

00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:46.930
He might be the lowest of the
Lannisters, but he's one of us.

00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:49.599
And every day
that he remains a prisoner,

00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:52.468
the less our name
commands respect.

00:05:52.503 --> 00:05:55.637
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinions of--

00:05:55.672 --> 00:05:57.673
No, it's not an opinion.
It's a fact.

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:02.710
If another House
can seize one of our own

00:06:02.744 --> 00:06:05.546
and hold him captive
with impunity,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.748
we are no longer
a House to be feared.

00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:14.389
Your mother's dead.

00:06:14.423 --> 00:06:16.592
Before long I'll be dead.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.460
And you

00:06:18.495 --> 00:06:20.763
and your brother
and your sister

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.700
and all of her children.
All of us dead;

00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:26.603
all of us rotting
in the ground.

00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:30.106
It's the family name
that lives on.

00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:32.643
It's all that lives on.

00:06:32.677 --> 00:06:36.113
Not your personal glory,
not your honor,

00:06:36.147 --> 00:06:38.782
but family.

00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:41.218
Do you understand?

00:06:43.321 --> 00:06:45.189
Hmm.

00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:55.367
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

00:06:55.402 --> 00:06:59.472
You are blessed to belong to the
most powerful family in the kingdoms.

00:06:59.507 --> 00:07:02.209
And you are still
blessed with youth.

00:07:03.544 --> 00:07:06.680
And what have you done
with these blessings, huh?

00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:10.217
You've served as a glorified
bodyguard for two kings--

00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:14.187
one a madman,
the other a drunk.

00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:22.794
The future of our family will be
determined in these next few months.

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:26.464
We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:30.569
Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.

00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:37.309
I need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.

00:07:38.244 --> 00:07:41.113
Not next year.
Not tomorrow.

00:07:41.147 --> 00:07:43.282
Now.

00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:15.245
You're in pain.

00:08:20.218 --> 00:08:22.220
I've had worse, My Lady.

00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:25.624
Perhaps it's time
to go home.

00:08:25.658 --> 00:08:27.659
The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.

00:08:27.694 --> 00:08:30.062
I know the truth
Jon Arryn died for.

00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:32.998
Do you, Lord Stark?

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:36.735
Is that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:40.306
Has he done this before?

00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:43.842
Jaime would have killed him.

00:08:43.877 --> 00:08:46.778
My brother is worth
a thousand of your friend.

00:08:46.813 --> 00:08:48.046
Your brother...

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.915
Or your lover?

00:08:54.687 --> 00:08:57.722
The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years

00:08:57.757 --> 00:08:59.691
to keep bloodlines pure.

00:08:59.725 --> 00:09:02.160
Jaime and I are more
than brother and sister.

00:09:02.194 --> 00:09:04.295
We shared a womb.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.398
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.368
My son saw you with him.

00:09:16.577 --> 00:09:18.211
Do you love your children?

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:20.246
- With all my heart.
- No more than I love mine.

00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:23.516
- And they are all Jaime's.
- Thank the Gods.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.719
In the rare event that
Robert leaves his whores

00:09:25.753 --> 00:09:27.483
for long enough to stumble
drunk into my bed,

00:09:27.508 --> 00:09:28.855
I finish him off in other ways.

00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:31.958
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

00:09:31.992 --> 00:09:35.261
Hated him?
I worshipped him.

00:09:35.295 --> 00:09:37.855
Every girl in the
Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him,

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.286
but he was mine by oath.

00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:41.467
And when I finally saw him

00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:43.468
on our wedding day
in the Sept of Baelor,

00:09:43.503 --> 00:09:46.104
lean and fierce
and black-bearded,

00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:48.340
it was the happiest moment
of my life.

00:09:49.843 --> 00:09:52.411
Then that night he crawled on
top of me, stinking of wine

00:09:52.445 --> 00:09:55.214
and did what he did--
what little he could do--

00:09:57.117 --> 00:09:59.453
and whispered
in my ear, "Lyanna."

00:10:01.556 --> 00:10:04.124
Your sister was a corpse
and I was a living girl

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:06.627
and he loved her
more than me.

00:10:08.563 --> 00:10:11.565
When the King returns from his
hunt, I'll tell him the truth.

00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:14.667
You must be gone by then--
you and your children.

00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:17.837
I will not have
their blood on my hands.

00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:19.905
Go as far away
as you can,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.541
with as many men
as you can.

00:10:22.575 --> 00:10:24.943
Because wherever you go,

00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:27.345
Robert's wrath
will follow you.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.948
And what of my wrath,
Lord Stark?

00:10:29.982 --> 00:10:32.584
You should have taken
the realm for yourself.

00:10:32.618 --> 00:10:35.487
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:38.423
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

00:10:38.457 --> 00:10:40.925
All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.728
Such a sad mistake.

00:10:43.763 --> 00:10:46.264
I've made many mistakes
in my life,

00:10:46.298 --> 00:10:49.000
but that wasn't
one of them.

00:10:49.034 --> 00:10:51.668
Oh, but it was.

00:10:51.703 --> 00:10:54.137
When you play the Game
of Thrones, you win

00:10:54.172 --> 00:10:56.439
or you die.

00:10:56.473 --> 00:10:58.574
There is no middle ground.

00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:08.683
Come here.

00:11:32.211 --> 00:11:36.080
Oh yes, oh.

00:11:36.115 --> 00:11:39.217
Oh yes yes yes.

00:11:45.758 --> 00:11:48.726
No no no no!

00:11:50.462 --> 00:11:53.097
Is that what they teach you up
in the North?

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:57.669
And you--
wherever you're from,

00:11:57.704 --> 00:12:00.906
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:05.211
Either of you understand
a thing that I'm saying?

00:12:05.246 --> 00:12:08.115
Yes, My Lord.

00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:10.517
Let's start over,
shall we?

00:12:11.752 --> 00:12:13.786
You be the man

00:12:13.821 --> 00:12:15.988
and you be the woman.

00:12:21.127 --> 00:12:23.194
Well, go ahead.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.797
Slowly.

00:12:34.974 --> 00:12:37.977
You're not fooling them.
They just paid you.

00:12:38.011 --> 00:12:40.646
They know what you are.

00:12:40.681 --> 00:12:42.816
They know it's all
just an act.

00:12:42.851 --> 00:12:45.819
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

00:12:45.854 --> 00:12:47.955
That takes time.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.825
You need to...

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.893
Ease into it.

00:12:55.264 --> 00:12:57.965
Go ahead.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.468
Ease into it.

00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:11.813
He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.

00:13:11.847 --> 00:13:14.349
You're starting
to like this.

00:13:15.418 --> 00:13:17.519
He wants to believe you.

00:13:17.554 --> 00:13:19.988
He's enjoyed his cock since he
was old enough to play with it.

00:13:20.023 --> 00:13:24.360
Why shouldn't you?
He knows he's better than other men.

00:13:24.394 --> 00:13:28.064
He's always known it deep down
inside. Now he has proof.

00:13:28.098 --> 00:13:30.900
He's so good,

00:13:30.934 --> 00:13:33.398
he's reaching something
deep inside of you that

00:13:33.423 --> 00:13:35.043
no one even knew was there,

00:13:35.239 --> 00:13:38.341
overcoming
your very nature.

00:13:40.378 --> 00:13:42.612
Why don't you join us,
My Lord?

00:13:44.015 --> 00:13:46.216
I'm saving myself
for another.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.818
What she doesn't know
won't hurt her.

00:13:48.852 --> 00:13:50.987
A stupid saying.

00:13:51.021 --> 00:13:54.089
What we don't know
is usually what gets us killed.

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:57.626
She must be
very beautiful.

00:13:57.661 --> 00:14:01.464
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines though.

00:14:01.498 --> 00:14:03.733
I do believe
My Lord's in love.

00:14:03.768 --> 00:14:06.570
For many years.
Most of my life really.

00:14:06.604 --> 00:14:08.371
Play with her ass.

00:14:08.406 --> 00:14:10.974
And she loved me too.

00:14:11.008 --> 00:14:12.976
I was her little confidant,

00:14:13.011 --> 00:14:15.445
her plaything.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.315
She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:22.119
She told me about all the
horses that she liked,

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:25.345
the castle she wanted
to live in and the man

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.790
that she wanted to marry.

00:14:27.192 --> 00:14:30.894
A northerner
with a jaw like an anvil.

00:14:32.588 --> 00:14:34.429
So I challenged him
to a duel.

00:14:34.432 --> 00:14:37.134
I mean, why not?
I'd read all the stories.

00:14:37.169 --> 00:14:40.938
The little hero always beats the
big villain in all the stories.

00:14:40.972 --> 00:14:45.409
In the end, she wouldn't
even let him kill me.

00:14:45.443 --> 00:14:48.078
"He's just a boy,"
she said.

00:14:48.112 --> 00:14:51.048
"Please don't hurt him."

00:14:51.082 --> 00:14:54.085
So he gave me a nice little
scar to remember him by

00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:56.754
- and off they went.
- Is she still married to him?

00:14:56.788 --> 00:14:58.049
Oh no.

00:14:58.074 --> 00:14:59.674
He got himself killed
before the wedding...

00:15:02.044 --> 00:15:03.744
..And she ended
up with his brother,

00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:05.697
an even more
impressive specimen.

00:15:05.731 --> 00:15:08.299
She loves him,
I'm afraid.

00:15:08.334 --> 00:15:12.036
And why wouldn't she?
I mean, who could compare to him?

00:15:12.071 --> 00:15:14.606
He's just so...

00:15:20.646 --> 00:15:21.946
Good.

00:15:24.516 --> 00:15:27.017
Do you know what I learned,
losing that duel?

00:15:27.986 --> 00:15:29.921
I learned that
I'll never win,

00:15:29.955 --> 00:15:33.124
not that way.
That's their game,

00:15:33.158 --> 00:15:35.927
their rules.

00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:37.929
I'm not going
to fight them.

00:15:37.963 --> 00:15:41.332
I'm going to fuck them.
That's what I know.

00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:43.601
That's what I am.

00:15:43.636 --> 00:15:46.471
And only by admitting what we
are can we get what we want.

00:15:47.873 --> 00:15:49.974
And what do you want?

00:15:50.008 --> 00:15:52.543
Oh, everything, my dear.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:55.646
Everything there is.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:01.651
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.

00:16:08.057 --> 00:16:09.658
Hmm.

00:16:32.584 --> 00:16:35.153
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:41.826
Where I come from, we don't
show mercy to criminals.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.862
Where I come from, if someone
like you attacked a little lord?

00:16:44.896 --> 00:16:48.598
At low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:52.002
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

00:16:52.036 --> 00:16:54.671
The sea would come in
closer and closer.

00:16:54.705 --> 00:16:58.508
You'd see death creeping toward
you a few inches at a time.

00:17:00.778 --> 00:17:02.579
Where is it you come from?

00:17:02.613 --> 00:17:04.314
The Iron Islands.

00:17:04.348 --> 00:17:05.882
They far away?

00:17:05.916 --> 00:17:08.384
You've never heard
of the Iron Islands?

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:12.221
Trust me, you've never heard
where I'm from neither.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.723
"Trust me, My Lord."

00:17:18.393 --> 00:17:20.661
You're not living
in the wilderness anymore.

00:17:20.696 --> 00:17:23.264
In civilized lands,
you refer to your betters

00:17:23.298 --> 00:17:25.399
by their proper titles.

00:17:25.433 --> 00:17:28.101
- And what's that?
- Lord.

00:17:28.136 --> 00:17:30.337
Why?

00:17:30.372 --> 00:17:32.674
Why?

00:17:32.708 --> 00:17:34.809
What do you mean why?

00:17:34.843 --> 00:17:38.146
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.948
What's that got
to do with you?

00:17:41.283 --> 00:17:42.884
If your father's lord,

00:17:42.918 --> 00:17:44.753
how can you be lord too?

00:17:44.787 --> 00:17:47.722
I will be lord
after my father--

00:17:47.757 --> 00:17:49.457
so you're not lord now?

00:17:49.492 --> 00:17:51.492
No, you--

00:17:52.928 --> 00:17:55.596
You having a go at me?
Is that it?

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:59.400
I just don't understand
how you Southerners do things.

00:17:59.434 --> 00:18:02.535
- I'm not a Southerner.
- You're from south of the wall.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.838
That makes you
a Southerner to me.

00:18:07.974 --> 00:18:10.810
You're an impudent
little wench, aren't you?

00:18:11.845 --> 00:18:13.579
Couldn't say, My Lord.

00:18:13.614 --> 00:18:15.649
Don't know what
"impunent" means.

00:18:15.683 --> 00:18:18.886
Impudent.
It means rude,

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.155
disrespectful.

00:18:25.227 --> 00:18:27.495
Do you want
to lose that chain?

00:18:29.464 --> 00:18:31.832
Theon Greyjoy!

00:18:31.866 --> 00:18:34.301
The lady is our guest.

00:18:34.335 --> 00:18:36.302
I thought she was
our prisoner.

00:18:36.337 --> 00:18:40.139
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

00:18:50.416 --> 00:18:53.552
Chances are I won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

00:18:53.586 --> 00:18:56.522
I'm used to worse than him.

00:18:56.556 --> 00:18:59.192
I'm used to men who could
chew that boy up

00:18:59.226 --> 00:19:01.961
and pick their teeth
with his bones.

00:19:06.968 --> 00:19:09.470
Why did you come here?

00:19:09.504 --> 00:19:11.839
Didn't mean to come here.

00:19:11.873 --> 00:19:14.541
Meant to get much
further south than this.

00:19:14.575 --> 00:19:17.510
As far south
as South goes,

00:19:17.545 --> 00:19:20.014
before the long night
comes.

00:19:20.048 --> 00:19:23.718
Why? What are you
afraid of?

00:19:23.752 --> 00:19:27.021
There's things that
sleep in the day

00:19:27.056 --> 00:19:30.023
- and hunt at night.
- Owls and Shadowcats and--

00:19:30.058 --> 00:19:32.626
I'm not talking about
Owls and Shadowcats.

00:19:36.797 --> 00:19:39.565
The "things" you speak of--

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.668
they've been gone
for thousands of years.

00:19:42.703 --> 00:19:44.837
They wasn't gone, old man.

00:19:46.073 --> 00:19:48.441
They was sleeping.

00:19:48.475 --> 00:19:51.344
And they ain't
sleeping no more.

00:20:00.322 --> 00:20:02.891
I miss girls.

00:20:02.925 --> 00:20:05.795
Not even talking to them.
I never talked to them.

00:20:07.731 --> 00:20:09.398
Just looking at them,

00:20:09.432 --> 00:20:11.066
hearing them giggle.

00:20:16.472 --> 00:20:18.773
Don't you miss girls?

00:20:23.178 --> 00:20:24.978
Riders.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.548
The horn.
We have to blow the horn.

00:20:29.717 --> 00:20:32.552
Why is he alone?

00:20:33.788 --> 00:20:35.622
One blast
for a Ranger returning,

00:20:35.656 --> 00:20:37.323
two for Wildlings,

00:20:37.357 --> 00:20:39.392
- three for--
- there's no rider.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.428
Whoa, boy, whoa.

00:21:14.462 --> 00:21:16.731
That's my
Uncle Benjen's horse.

00:21:24.674 --> 00:21:26.909
Where's my Uncle?

00:21:29.712 --> 00:21:32.013
Ned!

00:21:33.616 --> 00:21:36.417
It's Robert.
We were hunting--

00:21:36.452 --> 00:21:38.954
a boar--

00:21:44.694 --> 00:21:47.996
I should have
spent more time with you,

00:21:48.031 --> 00:21:51.500
shown you how to be a man.

00:21:54.437 --> 00:21:57.507
I was never meant
to be a father.

00:22:17.329 --> 00:22:19.698
Go on.

00:22:19.732 --> 00:22:21.900
You don't want to see this.

00:22:35.749 --> 00:22:38.217
My fault.

00:22:38.252 --> 00:22:41.554
Too much wine,
missed my thrust.

00:22:51.132 --> 00:22:53.834
It stinks.

00:22:53.868 --> 00:22:56.570
It stinks like death.

00:22:56.604 --> 00:22:59.272
Don't think
I can't smell it.

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:04.643
I paid
the bastard back, Ned.

00:23:04.678 --> 00:23:08.013
I drove my knife
right through his brain.

00:23:08.047 --> 00:23:10.716
You ask them if I didn't.
Ask them!

00:23:12.318 --> 00:23:14.786
I want the funeral feast
to be the biggest

00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:16.755
the Kingdoms ever saw.

00:23:18.057 --> 00:23:21.426
And I want everyone
to taste the boar that got me.

00:23:25.164 --> 00:23:28.400
Now leave us, the lot of you.
I need to talk to Ned.

00:23:29.636 --> 00:23:31.704
- Robert, my sweet--
- Out, all of you!

00:23:51.892 --> 00:23:54.226
You damned fool.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.629
Paper and ink
on the table,

00:23:56.663 --> 00:23:59.031
write down what I say.

00:24:06.239 --> 00:24:10.642
"In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

00:24:10.676 --> 00:24:13.345
first of--"
you know how it goes.

00:24:13.379 --> 00:24:15.881
Fill in the damn titles.

00:24:15.915 --> 00:24:18.484
"I hereby command

00:24:18.518 --> 00:24:21.354
Eddard of House Stark--"

00:24:21.388 --> 00:24:23.656
titles, titles--

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.493
"to serve as Lord Regent
and Protector of the Realm

00:24:27.527 --> 00:24:29.628
upon my death,

00:24:29.662 --> 00:24:32.464
to rule in my stead

00:24:32.498 --> 00:24:35.367
until my son Joffrey
comes of age."

00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:55.388
Give it over.

00:25:11.073 --> 00:25:13.108
Give it to the council

00:25:13.142 --> 00:25:14.843
after I'm dead.

00:25:16.178 --> 00:25:18.146
At least they'll say
I did this right,

00:25:18.181 --> 00:25:20.749
this one thing.

00:25:20.783 --> 00:25:23.385
You'll rule now.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.454
You'll hate it
worse than I did,

00:25:26.489 --> 00:25:29.658
but you'll do it well.

00:25:33.062 --> 00:25:35.296
The girl--

00:25:35.331 --> 00:25:38.065
Daenerys.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:42.303
You were right.
Varys, Littlefinger,

00:25:42.337 --> 00:25:44.805
my brother...
Worthless.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.410
No one to tell me "no"
but you.

00:25:49.444 --> 00:25:52.113
Only you.

00:25:54.883 --> 00:25:57.785
Let her live.

00:25:57.819 --> 00:26:00.488
Stop it,
if it's not too late.

00:26:00.522 --> 00:26:02.390
I will.

00:26:02.424 --> 00:26:04.659
And my son...

00:26:04.693 --> 00:26:07.294
Help him, Ned.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.731
Make him better than me.

00:26:11.633 --> 00:26:13.701
I'll...

00:26:13.735 --> 00:26:17.404
I'll do everything I can
to honor your memory.

00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:20.306
My memory.

00:26:22.443 --> 00:26:25.578
King Robert Baratheon,

00:26:25.612 --> 00:26:28.013
murdered by a pig.

00:26:31.552 --> 00:26:35.355
Give me something
for the pain and let me die.

00:26:49.772 --> 00:26:52.273
Give him
milk of the poppy.

00:26:59.948 --> 00:27:02.116
He was reeling
from the wine.

00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:06.054
He commanded us

00:27:06.088 --> 00:27:08.990
to step aside, but...

00:27:09.025 --> 00:27:10.691
I failed him.

00:27:12.928 --> 00:27:15.697
No man could have
protected him from himself.

00:27:17.567 --> 00:27:19.535
I wonder,
Ser Barristan,

00:27:19.569 --> 00:27:22.504
who gave the King
this wine?

00:27:23.739 --> 00:27:26.574
His squire,
from the King's own skin.

00:27:26.609 --> 00:27:29.210
His squire?
The Lannister boy?

00:27:29.245 --> 00:27:32.847
Such a dutiful boy
to make sure His Grace

00:27:32.882 --> 00:27:34.883
did not lack refreshment.

00:27:34.918 --> 00:27:38.187
I do hope the poor lad
does not blame himself.

00:27:46.564 --> 00:27:48.399
His Grace has had
a change of heart

00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:50.467
concerning
Daenerys Targaryen.

00:27:52.503 --> 00:27:56.305
Whatever
arrangements you made,

00:27:56.339 --> 00:27:58.674
unmake them.
At once.

00:27:58.708 --> 00:28:01.276
I'm afraid

00:28:01.311 --> 00:28:02.978
those birds have flown.

00:28:03.012 --> 00:28:05.414
The girl is likely
dead already.

00:28:59.235 --> 00:29:01.303
...Throne.

00:29:02.204 --> 00:29:04.539
Throne.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.351
Can't you help me
make him understand?

00:29:48.385 --> 00:29:51.321
The Dothraki do things in their
own time, for their own reasons.

00:29:51.355 --> 00:29:54.590
Have patience, Khaleesi.
We will go home, I promise you.

00:29:54.625 --> 00:29:56.993
My brother was
a fool, I know,

00:29:57.027 --> 00:29:59.829
but he was the rightful heir
to the Seven Kingdoms.

00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:03.299
Have I said
something funny, Ser?

00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:06.235
Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your
ancestor Aegon the Conqueror

00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:09.071
didn't seize six of the kingdoms
because they were his right.

00:30:09.106 --> 00:30:11.841
He had no right to them. He
seized them because he could.

00:30:11.875 --> 00:30:13.342
And because
he had dragons.

00:30:13.377 --> 00:30:16.112
Ah well, having a few dragons
makes things easier.

00:30:17.715 --> 00:30:20.684
- You don't believe it.
- Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?

00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:23.621
I believe what my eyes
and ears report.

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:26.858
As for the rest...
It was 300 years ago.

00:30:26.892 --> 00:30:28.660
Who knows
what really happened?

00:30:28.694 --> 00:30:31.362
Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek
out the merchant Captain,

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:32.897
see if he has
any letters for me.

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:35.399
- I'll come with you.
- No no, don't trouble yourself.

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:38.769
Enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:49.679
Psst, Jorah the Andal.

00:30:51.749 --> 00:30:53.951
The Spider sends
his greetings

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:56.186
and his congratulations.

00:30:58.223 --> 00:31:01.125
A royal pardon--
you can go home now.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:15.307
Virzetha gizikhven!
Mra qora! Mra qora!

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:45.001
My son already has his name,
but I'll try your summerwine.

00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:46.202
Just a taste.

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:49.406
My Lady, you are
from Westeros.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.311
You have the honor of addressing
Daenerys of the House Targaryen,

00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:57.716
Khaleesi of the Riding Men
and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.885
- Princess.
- Rise.

00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:01.854
I'd still like
to taste that wine.

00:32:01.889 --> 00:32:05.358
That? Dornish swill.

00:32:05.393 --> 00:32:07.894
Not worthy
of a princess.

00:32:07.929 --> 00:32:10.163
I have a dry red
from the Arbor--

00:32:10.197 --> 00:32:12.132
nectar of the Gods.

00:32:12.166 --> 00:32:15.001
Let me give you a cask.
Uh-- a gift.

00:32:15.036 --> 00:32:16.536
You honor me, Ser.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.206
The honor--
the honor is all mine.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.141
Huh-uh, huh-uh.

00:32:24.245 --> 00:32:27.814
There are many in your homeland
that pray for your return, princess.

00:32:27.849 --> 00:32:29.649
I hope to repay
your kindness someday.

00:32:29.684 --> 00:32:31.318
- Rakharo.
- Huh.

00:32:35.357 --> 00:32:37.726
- Is something wrong?
- I have a thirst.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.594
Open it.

00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:42.297
The wine is for the Khaleesi.
It's not for the likes of you.

00:32:42.332 --> 00:32:43.665
Open it.

00:32:54.944 --> 00:32:56.845
Pour.

00:32:56.879 --> 00:32:58.947
It would be a crime
to drink a wine this rich

00:32:58.982 --> 00:33:00.602
without at least
giving it time to breathe.

00:33:00.627 --> 00:33:02.656
Do as he says.

00:33:03.119 --> 00:33:04.820
As the princess commands.

00:33:17.134 --> 00:33:19.168
Sweet, isn't it?

00:33:19.203 --> 00:33:21.571
Can you smell
the fruit, Ser?

00:33:22.907 --> 00:33:24.641
Taste it, My Lord.

00:33:24.675 --> 00:33:26.509
Tell me that that
is not the finest wine

00:33:26.544 --> 00:33:28.745
that has ever touched
your tongue.

00:33:31.817 --> 00:33:34.151
You first.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.520
Me?

00:33:37.555 --> 00:33:39.956
I'm afraid I am not
worthy of the vintage.

00:33:40.254 --> 00:33:41.825
Besides, it is a poor
wine merchant who would

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:42.994
drink up his own wares.

00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:45.068
You will drink.

00:34:01.844 --> 00:34:04.012
- Khaleesi!
- Stop him!

00:34:17.291 --> 00:34:19.125
Come.

00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:28.800
You came to us
as outlaws,

00:34:28.835 --> 00:34:32.304
poachers, rapers,

00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:34.740
killers, thieves.

00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:37.576
You came alone,
in chains,

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.179
without friends

00:34:40.214 --> 00:34:42.382
nor honor.

00:34:42.416 --> 00:34:45.819
You came to us rich
and you came to us poor.

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:50.265
Some of you bear the names
of proud houses,

00:34:50.459 --> 00:34:54.027
others only bastard names
or no names at all.

00:34:54.061 --> 00:34:56.096
It does not matter.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.265
All that is in the past.

00:34:59.299 --> 00:35:01.767
Here,

00:35:01.802 --> 00:35:03.369
on the Wall,

00:35:03.403 --> 00:35:06.505
are all one house.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.276
- Tonight...
- You're allowed to look happy.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:14.412
You're going
to be a Ranger.

00:35:14.447 --> 00:35:17.449
Isn't that what you
always wanted?

00:35:17.483 --> 00:35:19.886
I want
to find my Uncle.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.722
I know he's alive
out there.

00:35:22.757 --> 00:35:24.324
I know he is.

00:35:25.727 --> 00:35:28.529
I wish I could help you,
but I'm no Ranger.

00:35:28.563 --> 00:35:31.432
It's the steward's life
for me.

00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:34.502
There's honor
in being a steward.

00:35:34.536 --> 00:35:36.904
Not much, really.

00:35:36.939 --> 00:35:38.739
But there's food.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.380
Here you begin anew.

00:35:53.088 --> 00:35:56.557
A man
of The Night's Watch...

00:35:58.093 --> 00:36:01.095
Lives his life
for the realm.

00:36:02.564 --> 00:36:04.465
Not for a King,

00:36:04.499 --> 00:36:07.702
or a lord, or the honor
of this house

00:36:07.736 --> 00:36:10.171
or that house;

00:36:10.205 --> 00:36:12.940
not for gold nor glory

00:36:12.975 --> 00:36:14.742
nor a woman's love;

00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:17.244
but for the realm

00:36:17.278 --> 00:36:20.046
and all the people in it.

00:36:20.081 --> 00:36:23.583
You've all learned
the words of the vow.

00:36:23.617 --> 00:36:27.320
Think carefully
before you say them.

00:36:27.354 --> 00:36:30.723
The penalty for desertion

00:36:30.758 --> 00:36:33.560
is death.

00:36:37.665 --> 00:36:39.933
You can take
your vows here

00:36:39.967 --> 00:36:43.804
tonight at sunset.

00:36:43.838 --> 00:36:46.540
Do any of you
still keep the Old Gods?

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.578
I do, My Lord.

00:36:50.613 --> 00:36:53.881
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your Uncle did.

00:36:53.916 --> 00:36:55.393
Yes, My Lord.

00:36:55.418 --> 00:36:57.810
You'll find a Weirwood
a mile north of the Wall.

00:36:57.886 --> 00:37:01.256
And your Old Gods too, maybe.

00:37:02.325 --> 00:37:05.294
My Lord,
might I go as well?

00:37:05.328 --> 00:37:07.296
Does House Tarly
keep the Old Gods?

00:37:07.331 --> 00:37:10.265
No, My Lord.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.367
I was named in the light
of the Seven,

00:37:12.402 --> 00:37:14.936
as my father was
and his father before him.

00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:19.075
Why would you forsake the Gods
of your father and your house?

00:37:21.345 --> 00:37:23.246
The Night's Watch
is my house now.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.815
The Seven have never
answered my prayers.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.485
Perhaps the Old Gods will.

00:37:30.588 --> 00:37:31.921
As you wish, lad.

00:37:31.956 --> 00:37:35.558
You've all been
assigned an order,

00:37:35.593 --> 00:37:38.995
according to our needs

00:37:39.029 --> 00:37:40.697
and your strengths.

00:37:40.731 --> 00:37:43.833
Halder to the builders.

00:37:44.702 --> 00:37:46.570
Pyp to the stewards.

00:37:46.604 --> 00:37:49.439
Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the Rangers.

00:37:49.473 --> 00:37:51.507
Samwell to the stewards.

00:37:51.542 --> 00:37:54.811
Matthar to the Rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.

00:37:54.845 --> 00:37:56.880
Balian to the Rangers.

00:37:56.914 --> 00:37:58.781
Rast to the Rangers.

00:37:58.816 --> 00:38:00.583
Jon to the stewards.

00:38:00.617 --> 00:38:02.451
Rancer to the builders.

00:38:02.486 --> 00:38:04.153
Echiel to the builders.

00:38:04.188 --> 00:38:05.388
Gordo to the stewards.

00:38:05.423 --> 00:38:09.259
Niko to the Rangers.
Escan to the Rangers.

00:38:09.294 --> 00:38:11.929
Vorkoy to the builders.
Joby to the stables.

00:38:11.963 --> 00:38:15.366
Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.

00:38:15.401 --> 00:38:17.736
Nelugo to the Rangers.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:21.473
May all the Gods
preserve you.

00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:28.913
Rangers with me.

00:38:28.948 --> 00:38:31.315
Builders!

00:38:50.036 --> 00:38:54.874
Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.

00:38:54.908 --> 00:38:58.978
Pyp, you will report to
Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

00:38:59.012 --> 00:39:03.749
Luke, report to one-eyed Joe
in the stables.

00:39:03.784 --> 00:39:07.453
Dareon, we are sending
you to Eastwatch.

00:39:07.488 --> 00:39:10.590
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

00:39:10.624 --> 00:39:13.927
Make no comment
about his nose.

00:39:15.363 --> 00:39:18.398
Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Mormont

00:39:18.432 --> 00:39:21.100
has requested you
for his personal steward.

00:39:21.134 --> 00:39:24.303
Will I serve
the Lord Commander's meals

00:39:24.337 --> 00:39:26.304
and fetch hot water
for his bath.

00:39:26.338 --> 00:39:27.555
Certainly.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.440
And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,

00:39:29.475 --> 00:39:32.711
change his sheets
and blankets daily

00:39:32.746 --> 00:39:36.581
and do everything else the
Lord Commander requires of you.

00:39:39.252 --> 00:39:41.120
Do you take me
for a servant?

00:39:41.154 --> 00:39:43.689
We took you for a man
of The Night's Watch.

00:39:43.723 --> 00:39:46.692
But perhaps we
were wrong in that.

00:39:47.727 --> 00:39:50.428
- May I go?
- As you wish.

00:39:56.135 --> 00:39:58.102
Jon, wait!

00:39:58.137 --> 00:40:00.071
Don't you see
what they're doing?

00:40:00.105 --> 00:40:02.106
I see Ser Alliser's revenge,
that's all.

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.041
He wanted it
and he got it.

00:40:04.075 --> 00:40:06.543
Stewards are nothing
but maids!

00:40:06.577 --> 00:40:08.711
I'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of you!

00:40:08.746 --> 00:40:12.482
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

00:40:12.517 --> 00:40:14.985
I was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall

00:40:15.019 --> 00:40:17.955
when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

00:40:17.989 --> 00:40:20.416
I pushed him away and he said
he'd have my hands cut off

00:40:20.441 --> 00:40:21.879
for stealing their silver.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.713
So now I'm here--
at the end of the world

00:40:23.738 --> 00:40:24.763
with no one to sing for

00:40:24.764 --> 00:40:26.665
but old men
and little shits like you.

00:40:26.699 --> 00:40:28.701
I'll never see
my family again.

00:40:28.735 --> 00:40:30.769
I'll never be inside
a woman again.

00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:32.315
So don't tell me about fair.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.240
I thought you were caught
stealing a wheel of cheese

00:40:34.306 --> 00:40:36.341
for your starving sister?

00:40:36.366 --> 00:40:37.736
You think I was gonna tell
a bunch of strangers

00:40:37.743 --> 00:40:40.377
that a high lord tried
to grab my cock?

00:40:42.547 --> 00:40:46.449
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
I'd like to hear a song.

00:40:51.555 --> 00:40:53.289
Now listen to me.

00:40:53.323 --> 00:40:56.259
The old man is the Lord Commander
of The Night's Watch.

00:40:56.293 --> 00:40:58.528
You'll be with him
day and night.

00:40:58.562 --> 00:41:01.030
Yes, you'll
clean his clothes.

00:41:01.064 --> 00:41:05.234
But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,

00:41:05.268 --> 00:41:06.969
squire for him in battle.

00:41:07.003 --> 00:41:10.339
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

00:41:10.374 --> 00:41:12.508
And he asked for you himself.

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:16.378
He wants to groom you
for command.

00:41:21.149 --> 00:41:23.817
I just...

00:41:23.852 --> 00:41:26.119
I always wanted
to be a Ranger.

00:41:28.289 --> 00:41:30.390
I always wanted
to be a Wizard.

00:41:32.927 --> 00:41:34.628
What?

00:41:34.662 --> 00:41:37.298
No, I'm serious.

00:41:37.332 --> 00:41:39.768
So you'll stay
and say your words with me?

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:49.679
Lord Stark, a moment.

00:41:50.815 --> 00:41:52.882
Alone if you will.

00:42:02.027 --> 00:42:05.296
He named you
Protector of the Realm.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:07.565
He did.

00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:09.366
She won't care.

00:42:09.401 --> 00:42:12.736
Give me an hour and I can put a
hundred swords at your command.

00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:14.772
And what should I do
with a hundred swords?

00:42:14.806 --> 00:42:18.209
Strike! Tonight
while the castle sleeps.

00:42:18.243 --> 00:42:22.247
We must get Joffrey away fro
his mother and into our custody.

00:42:22.282 --> 00:42:26.719
Protector of the Realm or no,
he who holds the King holds the Kingdom.

00:42:26.753 --> 00:42:30.390
Every moment you delay gives
Cersei another moment to prepare.

00:42:30.424 --> 00:42:33.559
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

00:42:33.593 --> 00:42:35.327
What about Stannis?

00:42:35.361 --> 00:42:38.563
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from
Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?

00:42:38.598 --> 00:42:41.399
You have odd notions about
protecting the realm.

00:42:41.433 --> 00:42:43.485
Stannis is your older brother.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.339
This isn't about the bloody
line of succession.

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:48.305
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.674
It shouldn't matter now.

00:42:50.709 --> 00:42:53.711
What's best
for the Kingdoms?

00:42:53.745 --> 00:42:56.781
What's best
for the people we rule?

00:42:57.917 --> 00:43:00.385
We all know
what Stannis is.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.388
He inspires
no love or loyalty.

00:43:03.423 --> 00:43:05.524
He's not a King.

00:43:05.559 --> 00:43:08.327
I am.

00:43:14.868 --> 00:43:16.835
Stannis is a commander.

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.739
He's led men
into war twice.

00:43:19.773 --> 00:43:22.041
He destroyed
the Greyjoy fleet--

00:43:22.076 --> 00:43:23.839
Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that.

00:43:23.864 --> 00:43:25.451
So was Robert.

00:43:25.914 --> 00:43:27.248
Tell me something:

00:43:27.282 --> 00:43:29.883
Do you still believe
good soldiers make good kings?

00:43:35.656 --> 00:43:37.858
I will not dishonor
Robert's last hours

00:43:37.892 --> 00:43:39.760
by shedding blood
in his halls

00:43:39.794 --> 00:43:42.897
and dragging frightened
children from their beds.

00:43:56.445 --> 00:43:59.147
You will sail
to Dragonstone tonight.

00:43:59.181 --> 00:44:01.950
You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.

00:44:03.586 --> 00:44:05.553
Not his steward,

00:44:05.588 --> 00:44:08.690
not his Captain
of the guard,

00:44:08.724 --> 00:44:11.259
and not his wife.

00:44:16.132 --> 00:44:17.699
Only Stannis himself.

00:44:17.733 --> 00:44:20.969
Yes, My Lord.

00:44:23.139 --> 00:44:24.640
Now leave us.

00:44:33.984 --> 00:44:36.653
My Lord Protector.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.929
The King has
no trueborn sons.

00:44:43.963 --> 00:44:46.565
Joffrey and Tommen

00:44:46.599 --> 00:44:48.600
are Jaime Lannister's
bastards.

00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:53.171
- So when the King dies--
- The throne passes

00:44:53.205 --> 00:44:56.407
to his brother
Lord Stannis.

00:44:56.442 --> 00:44:59.377
So it would seem.

00:45:01.146 --> 00:45:03.414
- Unless--
- there is no "unless."

00:45:03.448 --> 00:45:05.916
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.085
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

00:45:08.119 --> 00:45:09.519
You would be wise
to deny it to him

00:45:09.553 --> 00:45:12.255
and to make sure
Joffrey succeeds.

00:45:15.126 --> 00:45:17.895
Do you have
a shred of honor?

00:45:17.929 --> 00:45:21.800
You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.

00:45:21.834 --> 00:45:24.136
All of the power is yours.
You need only

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:26.672
reach out and take it.

00:45:26.706 --> 00:45:28.907
Make peace
with the Lannisters.

00:45:28.942 --> 00:45:32.312
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

00:45:32.346 --> 00:45:35.247
We have plenty of time
to get rid of Stannis.

00:45:35.282 --> 00:45:37.736
And if Joffrey seems likely
to cause problems when he

00:45:37.761 --> 00:45:39.061
comes into his throne,

00:45:39.153 --> 00:45:41.487
we simply reveal
his little secret

00:45:41.522 --> 00:45:43.456
and seat Lord Renly
there instead.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:44.622
We?

00:45:44.647 --> 00:45:46.358
You'll need someone
to share these burdens.

00:45:46.527 --> 00:45:50.463
I assure you--
my price would be modest.

00:45:51.531 --> 00:45:53.666
What you suggest is treason.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.934
Only if we lose.

00:45:58.304 --> 00:46:00.939
Make peace with
the Lannisters, you say...

00:46:02.674 --> 00:46:04.808
With the people
who tried to murder my boy.

00:46:04.843 --> 00:46:07.244
We only make peace
with our enemies, My Lord.

00:46:07.278 --> 00:46:10.680
That's why it's
called "making peace."

00:46:10.715 --> 00:46:13.984
No.
I won't do it.

00:46:14.018 --> 00:46:16.686
So it will be Stannis
and war?

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.921
There is no other choice.

00:46:18.956 --> 00:46:21.524
He is the heir.

00:46:22.593 --> 00:46:24.094
So why did you
call me here?

00:46:24.128 --> 00:46:26.763
Not for my wisdom,
clearly.

00:46:27.865 --> 00:46:29.967
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

00:46:30.001 --> 00:46:32.704
The Queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms--

00:46:32.738 --> 00:46:36.107
enough to overwhelm what
remains of my household guard.

00:46:36.142 --> 00:46:38.610
I need the gold cloaks.

00:46:38.645 --> 00:46:41.847
The City Watch
is 2,000 strong

00:46:41.882 --> 00:46:45.318
and sworn to defend
the King's peace.

00:46:48.023 --> 00:46:50.524
Look at you.

00:46:50.559 --> 00:46:52.893
You know what
you want me to do,

00:46:52.928 --> 00:46:55.029
you know it has
to be done,

00:46:55.063 --> 00:46:59.633
but it's not honorable
so the words stick in your throat.

00:46:59.667 --> 00:47:02.969
When the Queen
proclaims one King

00:47:03.004 --> 00:47:04.638
and the Hand
proclaims another,

00:47:04.672 --> 00:47:08.241
whose peace do
the Gold Cloaks protect?

00:47:08.276 --> 00:47:10.377
Who do they follow?

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:18.918
The man who pays them.

00:48:03.266 --> 00:48:07.437
Hear my words and bear
witness to my vow.

00:48:07.471 --> 00:48:11.207
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

00:48:11.242 --> 00:48:14.711
It shall not end
until my death.

00:48:14.745 --> 00:48:16.913
I shall take no wife,

00:48:16.947 --> 00:48:19.883
hold no lands,
father no children.

00:48:19.917 --> 00:48:24.287
I shall wear no crowns
and win no glory.

00:48:24.322 --> 00:48:28.057
I shall live and die
at my post.

00:48:28.092 --> 00:48:31.193
I am the sword
in the darkness.

00:48:31.228 --> 00:48:34.063
I am the watcher
on the Walls.

00:48:34.097 --> 00:48:37.399
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

00:48:37.433 --> 00:48:41.836
I pledge my li and honor
to The Night's Watch,

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:45.806
for this night and all
the nights to come.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.841
You knelt as boys.

00:48:47.876 --> 00:48:50.644
Rise now as men
of The Night's Watch.

00:49:03.927 --> 00:49:05.861
Well done.
Well done.

00:49:12.636 --> 00:49:14.470
What's he got there?

00:49:14.504 --> 00:49:17.673
To me, Ghost.
Bring it here.

00:49:19.776 --> 00:49:22.176
Gods be good!

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:31.285
What will they
do to him?

00:49:33.755 --> 00:49:36.590
When the Khalasar rides,
he'll be leashed to a saddle,

00:49:36.624 --> 00:49:39.393
forced to run behind the horses
for as long as he can.

00:49:39.427 --> 00:49:41.128
And when he falls?

00:49:43.064 --> 00:49:46.066
I saw a man
last nine miles once.

00:49:47.602 --> 00:49:49.870
King Robert
still wants me dead.

00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:52.206
This poisoner was the first.
He won't be the last.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.109
I thought
he'd leave me alone--

00:49:55.144 --> 00:49:56.811
now that my brother
is gone.

00:49:56.846 --> 00:49:58.847
He will never
leave you alone.

00:49:58.881 --> 00:50:02.551
If you ride to darkest Asshai,
his assassins will follow you.

00:50:02.585 --> 00:50:04.954
If you sailed all the way
to the Basilisk Isles,

00:50:04.988 --> 00:50:06.555
his spies would tell him.

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:09.359
He will never
abandon the hunt.

00:50:09.393 --> 00:50:13.329
You're a Targaryen--
the last Targaryen.

00:50:13.363 --> 00:50:15.598
Your son will have
Targaryen blood

00:50:15.632 --> 00:50:18.300
with 40,000 riders
behind him.

00:50:19.669 --> 00:50:21.669
He will not have my son.

00:50:22.904 --> 00:50:24.672
He will not have
you either, Khaleesi.

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:28.484
Lord Stark!

00:53:28.518 --> 00:53:30.987
- Stop!
- Ned: No, all right.

00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:32.955
It's all right.
Let him through.

00:53:32.989 --> 00:53:35.324
Lord Stark, King Joffrey
and the Queen Regent

00:53:35.358 --> 00:53:36.876
request your presence
in the Throne Room.

00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:38.194
King Joffrey?

00:53:38.195 --> 00:53:40.463
King Robert is gone.

00:53:40.497 --> 00:53:42.498
The Gods give him rest.

00:53:53.944 --> 00:53:56.579
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is yours.

00:53:56.614 --> 00:53:58.281
Good.

00:53:58.316 --> 00:54:00.384
Is Lord Renly joining us?

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.456
I fear Lord Renly
has left the city.

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:08.425
He rode through
the Old Gate

00:54:08.459 --> 00:54:09.693
an hour before dawn

00:54:09.728 --> 00:54:13.364
with Ser Loras Tyrell
and some 50 retainers.

00:54:13.398 --> 00:54:17.335
Last seen galloping south
in some haste.

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:40.191
We stand behind you,
Lord Stark.

00:54:49.568 --> 00:54:51.636
All hail his Grace,

00:54:51.671 --> 00:54:54.539
Joffrey of Houses
Baratheon and Lannister,

00:54:54.573 --> 00:54:56.141
the first of his name,

00:54:56.175 --> 00:54:58.610
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

00:54:58.644 --> 00:55:00.812
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

00:55:00.846 --> 00:55:04.049
and Protector of the Realm.

00:55:21.836 --> 00:55:24.289
I command the Council to make
all necessary arrangements

00:55:24.314 --> 00:55:25.767
for my coronation.

00:55:25.841 --> 00:55:28.209
I wish to be crowned
within the fortnight.

00:55:28.243 --> 00:55:31.045
Today I shall accept
oaths of fealty

00:55:31.079 --> 00:55:33.447
from my loyal councilors.

00:55:37.152 --> 00:55:39.286
Ser Barristan,

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.388
I believe no man here
could ever question your honor.

00:55:53.233 --> 00:55:57.102
King Robert's seal--
unbroken.

00:56:04.478 --> 00:56:07.080
"Lord Eddard Stark
is herein named

00:56:07.115 --> 00:56:10.151
Protector of the Realm,

00:56:10.185 --> 00:56:12.586
to rule as Regent

00:56:12.621 --> 00:56:15.790
until the heir
come of age."

00:56:16.858 --> 00:56:19.193
May I see that letter,
Ser Barristan?

00:56:27.636 --> 00:56:30.404
Protector of the realm.

00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:35.877
Is this meant
to be your shield, Lord Stark?

00:56:37.246 --> 00:56:39.180
A piece of paper?

00:56:42.184 --> 00:56:45.353
- Those were the King's words.
- We have a new King now.

00:56:48.391 --> 00:56:51.093
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offered me some counsel.

00:56:51.127 --> 00:56:54.664
Allow me to return
the courtesy.

00:56:54.698 --> 00:56:56.900
Bend the knee, My Lord.

00:56:56.934 --> 00:56:59.470
Bend the knee and swear
loyalty to my son--

00:57:00.706 --> 00:57:03.174
and we shall allow you
to live out your days

00:57:03.208 --> 00:57:05.577
in the gray waste
you call home.

00:57:05.611 --> 00:57:08.346
Your son has no claim
to the throne.

00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:10.115
Liar!

00:57:10.149 --> 00:57:12.684
You condemn yourself with
your own mouth, Lord Stark.

00:57:12.719 --> 00:57:14.753
Ser Barristan,
seize this traitor.

00:57:16.356 --> 00:57:19.492
Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man.
Do him no harm.

00:57:21.995 --> 00:57:23.496
You think
he stands alone?

00:57:26.033 --> 00:57:29.803
Kill him!
Kill all of them, I command it!

00:57:29.837 --> 00:57:31.838
Commander,

00:57:31.873 --> 00:57:34.341
take the Queen and her
children into custody.

00:57:34.375 --> 00:57:36.544
Escort them back
to the royal apartments

00:57:36.578 --> 00:57:38.212
and keep them there,
under guard.

00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:40.181
Men of the Watch!

00:57:44.419 --> 00:57:46.487
I want no bloodshed.

00:57:46.521 --> 00:57:49.389
Tell your men
to lay down their swords.

00:57:49.424 --> 00:57:51.391
No one needs to die.

00:57:53.094 --> 00:57:56.463
Now!

00:58:05.639 --> 00:58:08.408
I did warn you
not to trust me.
