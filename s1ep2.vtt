WEBVTT

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:06.678
There was a raven
from King's Landing.

00:00:06.953 --> 00:00:09.555
Jon Arryn is dead.

00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:11.515
The King rides
for Winterfell

00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:14.226
with the Queen
and all the rest of them.

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:16.328
The Queen
has two brothers?

00:00:16.363 --> 00:00:19.698
There's the pretty one,
and there's the clever one.

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.867
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:23.636
We were meant
to rule together.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.140
I have a son, you have a daughter.
We'll join our houses.

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.876
The boy I beheaded--
he was talking madness.

00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:32.945
Said the others
slaughtered his friends.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:35.548
- Ned: A Wildling ambush.
- Maybe.

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:36.958
You're Tyrion Lannister.

00:00:36.983 --> 00:00:39.276
You-- you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.587
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:44.790
Never forget what you are and it
can never be used to hurt you.

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:46.386
It's a direwolf.

00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:48.133
There are no direwolves
south of the Wall.

00:00:48.295 --> 00:00:51.063
Now there are five, one for
each of the Stark children.

00:00:51.098 --> 00:00:53.165
- What about you?
- I'm not a Stark.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.001
That one's yours, Snow.

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:59.638
May I present Viserys
of House Targaryen,

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:01.373
the rightful King
of the Andals,

00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:03.642
and his sister Daenerys?

00:01:03.677 --> 00:01:06.579
I don't want to be his queen.
I want to go home.

00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:11.684
We go home with an army--
with Khal Drogo's army.

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:13.072
From your sister.

00:01:13.097 --> 00:01:16.089
She says Jon Arryn was
murdered by the Lannisters.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.424
She says the King
is in danger.

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:20.292
What if Jon Arryn
told someone?

00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:23.395
Whatever Jon Arryn knew
died with him.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.768
The things I do for love.

You need to drink, child.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.980
And eat.

00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:54.952
Isn't there
anything else?

00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:58.623
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance:

00:03:58.657 --> 00:04:02.427
Grass and horses.
People can't live on grass.

00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:14.105
In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.507
they say there are
fields of ghost grass

00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:19.677
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:22.346
It murders
all other grass.

00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:24.849
The Dothraki believe
that one day

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:28.119
it will cover everything--
that's the way the world will end.

00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:43.167
It'll get easier.

00:05:21.273 --> 00:05:21.305
Khaleesi!

00:05:22.774 --> 00:05:24.742
Your hands.

00:05:35.287 --> 00:05:37.922
We're still not far
from Pentos, Your Grace.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.424
Magister Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:42.493
You'd be more
comfortable there.

00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:44.929
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

00:05:44.963 --> 00:05:47.431
I'll stay with Drogo
until he fulfills

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:49.767
his end of the bargain
and I have my crown.

00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:52.170
As you wish, Your Grace.

00:05:53.338 --> 00:05:55.406
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.842
I suppose it is preferable
to beheading.

00:05:59.378 --> 00:06:01.612
What did Ned Stark
want you for?

00:06:01.647 --> 00:06:03.614
Buying from a slaver?

00:06:03.682 --> 00:06:06.450
Selling to one--

00:06:06.518 --> 00:06:08.953
some poachers I caught
on my land.

00:06:10.556 --> 00:06:13.691
Under my reign, you won't be
punished for such nonsense.

00:06:13.725 --> 00:06:16.060
You can rest assured
of that.

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:43.654
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

00:06:47.593 --> 00:06:50.194
My mother's been
looking for you.

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.597
We ride for
King's Landing today.

00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:55.733
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

00:06:55.767 --> 00:06:57.835
and offer
your sympathies.

00:06:57.869 --> 00:07:00.805
What good will
my sympathies do them?

00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:05.343
None. But it is
expected of you.

00:07:05.377 --> 00:07:07.478
Your absence has
already been noted.

00:07:07.512 --> 00:07:09.647
The boy means
nothing to me.

00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:12.116
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:16.187
One word and I'll
hit you again.

00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:17.989
I'm telling mother!

00:07:18.857 --> 00:07:21.459
Go!
Tell her.

00:07:21.493 --> 00:07:23.594
But first you will get
to Lord and Lady Stark

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:25.630
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

00:07:25.664 --> 00:07:28.499
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

00:07:28.533 --> 00:07:32.003
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

00:07:32.037 --> 00:07:34.205
You can't--

00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:35.806
Do you understand?

00:07:42.614 --> 00:07:44.782
The prince will
remember that, little lord.

00:07:44.816 --> 00:07:46.817
I hope so.

00:07:46.852 --> 00:07:50.354
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:56.227
Ah.
Time for breakfast.

00:08:03.268 --> 00:08:06.404
Bread.
And two of those little fish.

00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:09.874
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

00:08:12.444 --> 00:08:14.512
And bacon,
burned black.

00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:16.514
Hyah.

00:08:16.548 --> 00:08:19.550
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

00:08:23.922 --> 00:08:25.923
Is Bran going to die?

00:08:27.726 --> 00:08:29.827
Apparently not.

00:08:31.997 --> 00:08:35.599
- What do you mean?
- The Maester says the boy may live.

00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:46.744
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

00:08:46.778 --> 00:08:48.546
Only the gods
know for certain.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.115
All the rest of us
can do is pray.

00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:55.119
The charms of the north
seem entirely lost on you.

00:08:55.153 --> 00:08:57.088
I still can't believe
you're going.

00:08:57.122 --> 00:08:59.123
It's ridiculous
even for you.

00:08:59.157 --> 00:09:00.891
Where's your sense
of wonder?

00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:05.129
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of The Night's Watch,

00:09:05.197 --> 00:09:07.732
the wintry abode
of the White Walkers.

00:09:07.766 --> 00:09:10.701
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

00:09:10.736 --> 00:09:13.637
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

00:09:13.672 --> 00:09:15.773
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

00:09:15.807 --> 00:09:17.775
No, I just want to stand
on top of the Wall

00:09:17.809 --> 00:09:19.910
and piss off
the edge of the world.

00:09:21.313 --> 00:09:23.981
The children don't need
to hear your filth.

00:09:25.817 --> 00:09:27.651
Come.

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:37.172
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

00:09:37.173 --> 00:09:40.359
Give me a good
clean death any day.

00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:44.835
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

00:09:44.903 --> 00:09:48.105
Death is so final,
whereas life...

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.141
Ah, life is full
of possibilities.

00:09:51.543 --> 00:09:53.043
I hope the boy does wake.

00:09:53.078 --> 00:09:55.679
I'd be very interested
to hear what he has to say.

00:09:58.183 --> 00:10:00.050
My dear brother,

00:10:00.085 --> 00:10:02.753
there are times you make me
wonder whose side you're on.

00:10:02.788 --> 00:10:05.122
My dear brother,
you wound me.

00:10:05.157 --> 00:10:07.725
You know how much
I love my family.

00:10:26.945 --> 00:10:28.179
Please.

00:10:28.213 --> 00:10:31.615
Oh, I would have
dressed, Your Grace.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.118
This is your home.
I'm your guest.

00:10:37.289 --> 00:10:39.323
Handsome one, isn't he?

00:10:39.357 --> 00:10:44.161
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

00:10:44.196 --> 00:10:47.298
He was a fighter too--

00:10:47.332 --> 00:10:50.668
tried to beat the fever
that took him.

00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:52.970
Forgive me.

00:10:53.004 --> 00:10:55.005
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.274
I never knew.

00:10:57.309 --> 00:10:59.143
It was years ago.

00:11:00.712 --> 00:11:03.681
Robert was crazed, beat
his hands bloody on the Wall,

00:11:03.748 --> 00:11:07.585
all the things men do to show
you how much they care.

00:11:12.457 --> 00:11:14.658
The boy looked
just like him.

00:11:16.328 --> 00:11:19.029
Such a little thing...

00:11:19.097 --> 00:11:21.932
A bird without feathers.

00:11:24.102 --> 00:11:28.939
They came to take his body away
and Robert held me.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.073
I screamed and I battled,
but he held me.

00:11:36.314 --> 00:11:38.315
That little bundle.

00:11:40.118 --> 00:11:42.586
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:44.955
Never have visited
the crypt, never.

00:11:55.567 --> 00:11:57.601
I pray to the Mother
every morning and night

00:11:57.636 --> 00:11:59.870
that she return
your child to you.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.541
I am grateful.

00:12:03.575 --> 00:12:06.644
Perhaps this time
she'll listen.

00:12:57.696 --> 00:12:59.730
A sword for the Wall?

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:04.468
- I already have one.
- Good man.

00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:07.705
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.

00:13:07.739 --> 00:13:09.373
At someone, I mean.

00:13:13.945 --> 00:13:17.047
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

00:13:17.082 --> 00:13:20.250
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat

00:13:20.285 --> 00:13:23.721
and blood and some bone
to keep it all standing.

00:13:25.924 --> 00:13:28.092
Let me thank you
ahead of time

00:13:28.126 --> 00:13:30.961
for guarding us all from
the perils beyond the Wall--

00:13:30.996 --> 00:13:33.597
Wildlings and White Walkers
and whatnot.

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:37.368
We're grateful to have

00:13:37.402 --> 00:13:39.770
good, strong men like you
protecting us.

00:13:42.307 --> 00:13:45.075
We've guarded the kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

00:13:47.746 --> 00:13:50.280
Is it "we" already?

00:13:51.816 --> 00:13:53.484
Have you taken
your vows then?

00:13:53.518 --> 00:13:54.785
Soon enough.

00:13:57.088 --> 00:13:59.356
Give my regards
to The Night's Watch.

00:13:59.391 --> 00:14:02.826
I'm sure it will be thrilling
to serve in such an elite force.

00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:04.795
And if not?

00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:07.698
It's only for life.

00:14:26.384 --> 00:14:28.452
Thank you, Nymeria.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.128
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

00:14:38.163 --> 00:14:40.798
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

00:14:40.832 --> 00:14:42.571
Who cares how they're folded?!

00:14:42.572 --> 00:14:43.997
They're going to get all
messed up anyway.

00:14:45.204 --> 00:14:46.370
It's good
you've got help.

00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:48.205
Watch.

00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:50.140
Nymeria, gloves.

00:14:56.247 --> 00:14:58.248
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

00:14:58.283 --> 00:15:00.884
Nymeria, gloves!

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.755
I have something for you.

00:15:04.789 --> 00:15:07.124
And it has to be packed
very carefully.

00:15:07.158 --> 00:15:08.959
A present?

00:15:08.993 --> 00:15:11.095
Close the door.

00:15:23.475 --> 00:15:25.943
This is no toy.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.448
Be careful you don't
cut yourself.

00:15:34.185 --> 00:15:36.353
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:39.456
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

00:15:39.491 --> 00:15:40.958
It won't hack
a man's head off,

00:15:40.992 --> 00:15:43.127
but it can poke him full
of holes if you're quick enough.

00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:44.198
I can be quick.

00:15:44.223 --> 00:15:45.919
You'll have to work
at it every day.

00:15:47.098 --> 00:15:48.532
How does it feel?

00:15:48.566 --> 00:15:51.235
Do you like
the balance?

00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:53.437
I think so.

00:15:54.806 --> 00:15:57.274
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.

00:15:57.308 --> 00:15:59.343
I know which end to use.

00:16:04.816 --> 00:16:06.884
I'm going to miss you.

00:16:08.453 --> 00:16:09.887
Careful.

00:16:21.099 --> 00:16:24.034
All the best swords
have names, you know.

00:16:26.771 --> 00:16:29.406
Sansa can keep
her sewing needles.

00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:33.010
I've got a needle
of my own.

00:16:47.725 --> 00:16:49.827
I came to say
goodbye to Bran.

00:16:49.861 --> 00:16:51.595
You've said it.

00:17:02.307 --> 00:17:05.342
I wish I could be here
when you wake up.

00:17:08.313 --> 00:17:10.848
I'm going north
with Uncle Benjen.

00:17:10.882 --> 00:17:12.649
I'm taking the black.

00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:24.294
I know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:28.198
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

00:17:30.034 --> 00:17:32.369
I'll know my way
around by then.

00:17:32.403 --> 00:17:35.172
I'll be a sworn brother
of The Night's Watch.

00:17:40.245 --> 00:17:43.280
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.

00:17:57.896 --> 00:18:00.130
I want you

00:18:00.198 --> 00:18:01.798
to leave.

00:19:02.126 --> 00:19:04.294
17 years ago

00:19:04.329 --> 00:19:06.496
you rode off
with Robert Baratheon.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.035
You came back a year later with
another woman's son.

00:19:13.504 --> 00:19:16.206
And now
you're leaving again.

00:19:18.876 --> 00:19:20.644
I have no choice.

00:19:20.678 --> 00:19:24.548
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

00:19:24.582 --> 00:19:28.151
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:32.055
You do have a choice.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.858
And you've made it.

00:19:37.996 --> 00:19:40.030
Cat--

00:19:45.703 --> 00:19:48.405
I can't do it, Ned.

00:19:51.376 --> 00:19:54.578
- I really can't.
- You can.

00:19:56.881 --> 00:19:58.682
You must.

00:20:22.106 --> 00:20:24.641
You've said
goodbye to Bran?

00:20:24.675 --> 00:20:27.110
He's not going to die.
I know it.

00:20:27.145 --> 00:20:29.446
You Starks
are hard to kill.

00:20:30.348 --> 00:20:32.049
My mother?

00:20:32.083 --> 00:20:34.551
- She was very kind.
- Good.

00:20:36.287 --> 00:20:38.555
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

00:20:38.589 --> 00:20:40.757
It was always my color.

00:20:41.959 --> 00:20:45.095
- Farewell, Snow.
- And you, Stark.

00:21:37.548 --> 00:21:40.083
There's great honor serving
in The Night's Watch.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.555
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.558
And you are a Stark.

00:21:48.593 --> 00:21:50.827
You might not have my name,

00:21:50.895 --> 00:21:52.996
but you have my blood.

00:21:59.337 --> 00:22:01.738
Is my mother alive?

00:22:01.772 --> 00:22:04.975
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

00:22:06.577 --> 00:22:08.678
Does she care?

00:22:09.847 --> 00:22:12.149
The next time
we see each other,

00:22:12.183 --> 00:22:14.518
we'll talk
about your mother.

00:22:14.552 --> 00:22:16.419
Huh?

00:22:16.454 --> 00:22:18.522
I promise.

00:22:58.129 --> 00:23:01.131
Gods, this is country!

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.469
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

00:23:08.606 --> 00:23:10.907
I've half a mind
to go with you.

00:23:10.942 --> 00:23:12.976
What do you say,
just you and me

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.545
on the Kingsroad,
swords at our sides,

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.149
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

00:23:19.183 --> 00:23:21.851
You should have
asked me 20 years ago.

00:23:21.886 --> 00:23:24.754
There were wars to fight,
women to marry--

00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:26.856
we never had the chance
to be young.

00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:28.892
I recall
a few chances.

00:23:32.763 --> 00:23:35.432
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

00:23:35.466 --> 00:23:37.434
That common girl of yours?

00:23:37.468 --> 00:23:40.270
Becca? With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

00:23:40.338 --> 00:23:42.639
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

00:23:42.673 --> 00:23:46.309
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie

00:23:46.344 --> 00:23:49.179
and her tits.

00:23:49.213 --> 00:23:51.615
Yours was... Aleena?

00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:54.718
No. You told me once.
Meryl?

00:23:54.752 --> 00:23:56.786
Your bastard's mother?

00:23:58.422 --> 00:24:00.690
- Wylla.
- That's it.

00:24:00.725 --> 00:24:02.892
She must have been
a rare wench

00:24:02.927 --> 00:24:05.762
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

00:24:05.796 --> 00:24:08.031
You never told me
what she looked like.

00:24:08.065 --> 00:24:10.433
Nor will I.

00:24:12.903 --> 00:24:14.771
We were at war.

00:24:14.805 --> 00:24:17.474
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

00:24:17.508 --> 00:24:20.977
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.082
I swear if I weren't your King,
you'd have hit me already.

00:24:26.117 --> 00:24:29.152
The worst thing
about your coronation--

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.755
I'll never get
to hit you again.

00:24:33.924 --> 00:24:36.493
Trust me, that's not
the worst thing.

00:24:40.464 --> 00:24:42.499
There was a rider
in the night.

00:24:48.572 --> 00:24:52.075
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

00:24:52.109 --> 00:24:54.778
What of it?
Should we send her a wedding gift?

00:24:54.812 --> 00:24:56.513
A knife perhaps,
a good sharp one,

00:24:56.547 --> 00:24:58.481
and a bold man to wield it.

00:24:58.549 --> 00:25:00.483
She's little more
than a child.

00:25:00.518 --> 00:25:03.753
Soon enough that child will spread
her legs and start breeding.

00:25:03.788 --> 00:25:07.457
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:11.361
What her father did to your family--
that was unspeakable.

00:25:11.395 --> 00:25:13.463
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister--

00:25:13.497 --> 00:25:15.632
the woman I loved.

00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:18.935
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.

00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:21.171
But you can't get
your hands on this one, can you?

00:25:21.205 --> 00:25:23.139
This Khal Drogo,

00:25:23.174 --> 00:25:25.508
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

00:25:25.543 --> 00:25:28.311
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

00:25:28.346 --> 00:25:31.147
as long as they remain on the
other side of the Narrow Sea.

00:25:31.182 --> 00:25:33.149
They have no ships,
Robert.

00:25:33.184 --> 00:25:36.353
There are still those in the
Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper.

00:25:37.888 --> 00:25:41.157
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

00:25:41.192 --> 00:25:43.993
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

00:25:45.696 --> 00:25:48.865
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

00:25:53.637 --> 00:25:55.739
There's a war coming, Ned.

00:25:55.773 --> 00:25:57.607
I don't know when,

00:25:57.641 --> 00:26:00.176
I don't know who
we'll be fighting,

00:26:00.211 --> 00:26:01.711
but it's coming.

00:27:13.451 --> 00:27:15.351
Sit.

00:27:15.386 --> 00:27:17.387
You'll be fed.

00:27:20.691 --> 00:27:23.059
Untie them.

00:27:23.093 --> 00:27:26.563
Ah, rapers.

00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:32.402
They were given a choice no doubt--
castration or the Wall.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.871
Most choose the knife.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.412
Not impressed
by your new brothers?

00:27:45.115 --> 00:27:47.050
Lovely thing
about the Watch--

00:27:47.084 --> 00:27:50.587
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

00:27:59.263 --> 00:28:01.431
Why do you read so much?

00:28:01.465 --> 00:28:04.734
Look at me and tell me
what you see.

00:28:05.903 --> 00:28:07.770
Is this a trick?

00:28:07.838 --> 00:28:11.541
What you see is a dwarf.

00:28:11.575 --> 00:28:15.011
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

00:28:15.045 --> 00:28:18.848
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

00:28:18.883 --> 00:28:21.417
Things are expected of me.

00:28:21.452 --> 00:28:23.887
My father was the Hand
of the King for 20 years.

00:28:23.921 --> 00:28:26.122
Until your brother
killed that King.

00:28:31.629 --> 00:28:35.598
Yes, until my brother
killed him.

00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:40.136
Life is full of these
little ironies.

00:28:41.338 --> 00:28:43.306
My sister married
the new King

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.543
and my repulsive nephew
will be King after him.

00:28:49.146 --> 00:28:52.448
I must do my part for the honor
of my house, wouldn't you agree?

00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:56.085
But how?

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.922
Well, my brother
has his sword

00:28:58.956 --> 00:29:00.823
and I have my mind.

00:29:00.891 --> 00:29:04.193
And a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

00:29:04.228 --> 00:29:07.330
That's why I read
so much, Jon Snow.

00:29:10.668 --> 00:29:13.136
And you?

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.505
What's your story,
bastard?

00:29:17.708 --> 00:29:20.710
Ask me nicely and maybe
I'll tell you, dwarf.

00:29:24.481 --> 00:29:27.450
A bastard boy
with nothing to inherit,

00:29:27.484 --> 00:29:29.419
off to join

00:29:29.453 --> 00:29:31.921
the ancient order
of The Night's Watch,

00:29:31.956 --> 00:29:35.925
alongside his Valiant
brothers-in-arms.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.027
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from--

00:29:38.062 --> 00:29:41.297
ah, yes yes, against grumpkins
and snarks

00:29:41.332 --> 00:29:44.767
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

00:29:44.802 --> 00:29:47.170
You're a smart boy.

00:29:47.204 --> 00:29:49.806
You don't believe
that nonsense.

00:29:57.147 --> 00:30:00.283
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

00:30:34.685 --> 00:30:38.554
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

00:30:38.622 --> 00:30:42.725
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

00:30:44.294 --> 00:30:46.896
Talk to Poole about it.

00:30:48.232 --> 00:30:51.334
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

00:30:51.368 --> 00:30:54.070
We need a new steward,

00:30:54.104 --> 00:30:57.273
and there are several other
appointments that require

00:30:57.307 --> 00:31:01.411
- our immediate attention--
- I don't care about appointments!

00:31:02.713 --> 00:31:04.580
I'll make the appointments.

00:31:07.317 --> 00:31:09.232
We'll talk about it
first thing in the morning.

00:31:09.257 --> 00:31:11.457
Very good, my Lord.

00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:15.324
My Lady.

00:31:28.205 --> 00:31:30.406
When was the last time
you left this room?

00:31:30.441 --> 00:31:33.076
I have to take care
of him.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.977
He's not going
to die, mother.

00:31:34.978 --> 00:31:37.189
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:38.556
What if he's wrong?

00:31:38.652 --> 00:31:42.356
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

00:31:42.419 --> 00:31:44.353
He's six.

00:31:44.388 --> 00:31:47.790
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

00:31:47.825 --> 00:31:50.259
- clutching my leg, crying--
- close the windows!

00:31:50.294 --> 00:31:52.462
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

00:31:56.166 --> 00:31:58.668
Fire.

00:31:58.702 --> 00:32:00.870
You stay here.
I'll come back.

00:32:18.589 --> 00:32:21.090
You're not supposed
to be here.

00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:23.826
No one is
supposed to be here.

00:32:23.894 --> 00:32:27.463
It's a mercy.
He's dead already.

00:32:30.134 --> 00:32:32.835
No!

00:33:38.569 --> 00:33:42.338
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

00:33:42.372 --> 00:33:45.408
Everywhere?
Even in the east?

00:33:45.442 --> 00:33:48.377
No dragon.
Brave men kill them.

00:33:48.412 --> 00:33:51.614
- It is known.
- It is known.

00:33:51.648 --> 00:33:55.685
A trader from Garth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

00:33:55.719 --> 00:33:58.054
The moon?

00:33:58.121 --> 00:34:00.289
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

00:34:00.324 --> 00:34:03.359
that once there were
two moons in the sky.

00:34:03.393 --> 00:34:07.230
But one wandered too close
to the sun and it cracked from the heat.

00:34:07.264 --> 00:34:10.499
Out of it poured a thousand
thousand dragons

00:34:10.534 --> 00:34:12.468
and they drank
the sun's fire.

00:34:12.502 --> 00:34:15.404
Moon is no egg.

00:34:15.439 --> 00:34:18.274
Moon is goddess--
wife of sun.

00:34:18.308 --> 00:34:21.077
- It is known.
- It is known.

00:34:22.613 --> 00:34:24.580
Leave me with her.

00:34:32.422 --> 00:34:35.691
Why did the trader from Garth
tell you these stories?

00:34:35.726 --> 00:34:38.928
Men like to talk
when they're happy.

00:34:38.962 --> 00:34:40.997
Before your brother
bought me for you,

00:34:41.031 --> 00:34:43.099
it was my job
to make men happy.

00:34:43.166 --> 00:34:46.335
- How old were you?
- I was nine

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:48.371
when my mother sold me
to the pleasure house.

00:34:48.405 --> 00:34:49.906
Nine?!

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.376
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:54.944
First

00:34:54.978 --> 00:34:56.946
you must learn.

00:34:59.783 --> 00:35:03.286
Can you teach me how
to make the Khal happy?

00:35:04.488 --> 00:35:08.391
- Yes.
- Will it take three years?

00:35:09.793 --> 00:35:11.460
No.

00:35:32.916 --> 00:35:35.117
Welcome.

00:37:05.509 --> 00:37:09.078
What I am about to tell
you must remain between us.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.215
I don't think Bran
fell from that tower.

00:37:14.418 --> 00:37:16.419
I think he was thrown.

00:37:17.754 --> 00:37:20.523
The boy was always
sure-footed before.

00:37:20.557 --> 00:37:23.292
Someone tried
to kill him twice.

00:37:23.326 --> 00:37:26.429
Why?
Why murder an innocent child?

00:37:26.463 --> 00:37:29.198
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

00:37:29.232 --> 00:37:31.934
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

00:37:33.503 --> 00:37:35.738
But I would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

00:37:35.772 --> 00:37:39.208
We already have reason
to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

00:37:39.242 --> 00:37:41.544
Did you notice the dagger
the killer used?

00:37:41.578 --> 00:37:44.013
It's too fine a weapon
for such a man.

00:37:44.047 --> 00:37:47.349
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

00:37:47.384 --> 00:37:49.285
Someone gave it to him.

00:37:50.687 --> 00:37:54.223
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

00:37:54.257 --> 00:37:56.478
If it's war they want--

00:37:56.503 --> 00:37:58.191
If it comes to that, you know
I'll stand behind you.

00:37:58.195 --> 00:38:01.063
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

00:38:01.098 --> 00:38:03.065
Huh?

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.068
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

00:38:06.103 --> 00:38:08.137
We don't know
the truth yet.

00:38:08.205 --> 00:38:10.739
Lord Stark
must be told of this.

00:38:10.774 --> 00:38:13.709
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

00:38:13.743 --> 00:38:15.644
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:18.981
There must always be
a Stark in Winterfell.

00:38:19.015 --> 00:38:21.317
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

00:38:21.384 --> 00:38:23.519
I must.

00:38:23.553 --> 00:38:26.255
I'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

00:38:26.289 --> 00:38:28.791
Too large a party attracts
unwanted attention.

00:38:28.825 --> 00:38:31.127
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

00:38:31.161 --> 00:38:32.995
Let me accompany you
at least.

00:38:33.029 --> 00:38:35.931
The Kingsroad can be a
dangerous place for a woman alone.

00:38:39.669 --> 00:38:42.004
What about Bran?

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.642
I have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

00:38:47.811 --> 00:38:51.180
Bran's life is
in their hands now.

00:39:49.873 --> 00:39:52.141
No, Khaleesi.

00:39:52.175 --> 00:39:54.977
You must look
in his eyes always.

00:39:55.011 --> 00:39:57.046
Love comes in at the eyes.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.517
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

00:40:01.551 --> 00:40:03.586
with nothing
but her eyes.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.921
Finish a man?

00:40:07.424 --> 00:40:09.525
Oh.

00:40:09.559 --> 00:40:14.096
Kings traveled across
the world for a night with Irogenia.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.765
Magisters sold
their palaces.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.536
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:24.340
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

00:40:24.374 --> 00:40:27.209
and she refused them all.

00:40:27.244 --> 00:40:30.813
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

00:40:30.847 --> 00:40:32.781
I-- I don't think

00:40:32.816 --> 00:40:35.084
that Drogo will like it
with me on top.

00:40:35.118 --> 00:40:37.620
You will make him
like it, Khaleesi.

00:40:37.654 --> 00:40:39.888
Men want what
they've never had.

00:40:39.923 --> 00:40:43.125
And the Dothraki take slaves
like a hound takes a bitch.

00:40:43.159 --> 00:40:46.629
Are you a slave,
Khaleesi?

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.109
Then don't make love
like a slave.

00:41:08.485 --> 00:41:10.853
Very good, Khaleesi.

00:41:10.887 --> 00:41:13.055
Out there
he is the mighty Khal,

00:41:13.089 --> 00:41:17.159
but in this tent,
he belongs to you.

00:41:17.193 --> 00:41:19.428
I-- I don't think

00:41:19.462 --> 00:41:21.530
that this is
the Dothraki way.

00:41:21.564 --> 00:41:24.133
If he wanted
the Dothraki way,

00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:27.169
why did he marry you?

00:42:15.618 --> 00:42:18.487
No.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.791
No!

00:42:22.826 --> 00:42:27.496
Ajjalan anha zalat
vitiherat yer hatif.

00:44:13.937 --> 00:44:15.771
Pardon me, Ser.

00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:21.944
Do I frighten you
so much, girl?

00:44:23.646 --> 00:44:26.415
Or is it him there
making you shake?

00:44:26.449 --> 00:44:29.051
He frightens
me too.

00:44:29.085 --> 00:44:31.553
Look at
that face.

00:44:31.588 --> 00:44:34.356
I'm sorry
if I offended you, Ser.

00:44:40.964 --> 00:44:42.932
Why won't he speak to me?

00:44:42.933 --> 00:44:45.133
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

00:44:45.134 --> 00:44:48.203
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

00:44:48.238 --> 00:44:50.973
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

00:44:51.007 --> 00:44:54.776
Ser Ilyn Payne,
the King's justice.

00:44:56.279 --> 00:44:58.413
The royal
executioner.

00:44:59.716 --> 00:45:02.885
What is it, sweet lady?

00:45:04.454 --> 00:45:06.522
Does the Hound frighten you?

00:45:06.556 --> 00:45:08.257
Away with you, dog.

00:45:08.291 --> 00:45:10.959
You're scaring
my lady.

00:45:13.162 --> 00:45:15.297
I don't like
to see you upset.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.601
The Sun is finally shining.

00:45:19.636 --> 00:45:21.403
Come walk with me.

00:45:23.339 --> 00:45:25.474
Stay, lady.

00:45:42.125 --> 00:45:44.326
I probably shouldn't
have any more.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.728
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

00:45:46.763 --> 00:45:49.831
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

00:46:02.245 --> 00:46:05.013
Don't worry--
you're safe with me.

00:46:06.015 --> 00:46:08.116
I'll get you!

00:46:13.289 --> 00:46:16.224
- Arya!
- Ow!

00:46:16.259 --> 00:46:17.826
What are you doing here?

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.329
- Go away.
- Your sister?

00:46:24.067 --> 00:46:26.868
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my Lord.

00:46:26.903 --> 00:46:29.004
- He the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

00:46:29.038 --> 00:46:32.507
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a Knight, eh?

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:36.945
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.581
She asked me to, my Lord.
She asked me to.

00:46:39.616 --> 00:46:41.583
I'm your prince,

00:46:41.618 --> 00:46:43.552
not your lord,

00:46:43.586 --> 00:46:47.189
and I said pick up
your sword.

00:46:47.256 --> 00:46:49.591
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

00:46:49.626 --> 00:46:51.493
And you're not a Knight.

00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:55.063
Only a butcher's boy.

00:46:55.098 --> 00:46:58.133
That was my lady's sister
you were hitting, do you know that?

00:46:58.167 --> 00:47:00.502
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

00:47:01.437 --> 00:47:03.205
I won't hurt him...

00:47:03.239 --> 00:47:04.840
Much.

00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:14.616
Arya!

00:47:15.618 --> 00:47:17.019
Filthy little bitch!

00:47:17.053 --> 00:47:18.954
No no, stop it, stop it,
both of you.

00:47:18.988 --> 00:47:22.324
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

00:47:22.358 --> 00:47:24.993
I'll gut you,
you little cunt!

00:47:27.697 --> 00:47:29.798
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

00:47:29.832 --> 00:47:32.401
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

00:47:37.273 --> 00:47:39.207
No.

00:47:39.242 --> 00:47:41.843
No.
Please don't.

00:47:41.878 --> 00:47:44.312
Arya, leave him alone.

00:48:02.899 --> 00:48:06.368
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

00:48:06.402 --> 00:48:08.837
Stay here, I'll go back
to the inn and bring help.

00:48:08.871 --> 00:48:10.205
Then go!

00:48:12.008 --> 00:48:14.443
Don't touch me.

00:48:16.446 --> 00:48:19.414
The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.

00:48:25.421 --> 00:48:29.391
You've got to go. They'll kill you for
what you did to Joffrey.

00:48:29.425 --> 00:48:31.560
Go on-- run.

00:48:34.664 --> 00:48:36.832
Go!
Leave now!

00:48:38.935 --> 00:48:41.403
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.

00:48:46.976 --> 00:48:50.579
I think I heard a noise.

00:48:52.148 --> 00:48:53.782
Go!

00:49:05.762 --> 00:49:08.897
Arya!

00:49:08.931 --> 00:49:13.635
- Distant man: Arya!
- Ned: Arya!

00:49:13.669 --> 00:49:16.571
Arya-aa!

00:49:17.707 --> 00:49:19.775
Arya!

00:49:19.809 --> 00:49:21.543
Arya!

00:49:21.577 --> 00:49:23.512
My lord!

00:49:23.546 --> 00:49:25.947
My lord!
They found her.

00:49:25.982 --> 00:49:28.450
She's unharmed.

00:49:28.484 --> 00:49:30.002
Where is she?

00:49:30.027 --> 00:49:31.753
She's been taken
directly before the King.

00:49:31.808 --> 00:49:33.642
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

00:49:33.918 --> 00:49:36.086
- Arya-aa!
- Right, get back.

00:49:36.156 --> 00:49:38.536
The Queen ordered
them to bring her straight to him.

00:49:38.757 --> 00:49:40.992
Back!
Back to the inn.

00:49:41.197 --> 00:49:43.064
All back!

00:49:50.706 --> 00:49:52.574
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

00:49:52.608 --> 00:49:54.342
- Are you hurt?
- No.

00:49:54.377 --> 00:49:56.912
Oh, it's all right.

00:49:58.614 --> 00:50:01.349
What is
the meaning of this?

00:50:01.417 --> 00:50:04.136
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:06.150
How dare you speak
to your King in that manner?

00:50:06.175 --> 00:50:07.375
Quiet, woman.

00:50:08.324 --> 00:50:11.226
Sorry, Ned.
I never meant to frighten the girl.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.528
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

00:50:13.596 --> 00:50:17.165
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.835
That animal of hers
nearly tore his arm off.

00:50:19.869 --> 00:50:21.803
That's not true!

00:50:21.838 --> 00:50:24.306
She just...
bit him a little.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.943
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

00:50:27.977 --> 00:50:29.878
You and that boy
beat him with clubs

00:50:29.912 --> 00:50:32.781
- while you set your wolf on him.
- That's not what happened!

00:50:32.815 --> 00:50:34.441
Yes it is!

00:50:34.466 --> 00:50:36.216
They all attacked me and she
threw my sword in the river.

00:50:36.219 --> 00:50:37.485
- Liar!
- Shut up!

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.920
Enough!

00:50:38.955 --> 00:50:41.990
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

00:50:42.024 --> 00:50:44.392
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

00:50:46.462 --> 00:50:48.520
Where's your
other daughter, Ned?

00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:49.897
In bed asleep.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.661
She's not.

00:50:52.553 --> 00:50:54.888
Sansa, come here, darling.

00:51:04.847 --> 00:51:06.848
Now, child...

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:09.818
Tell me what happened.

00:51:09.852 --> 00:51:11.920
Tell it all
and tell it true.

00:51:11.954 --> 00:51:14.589
It's a great crime
to lie to a King.

00:51:22.999 --> 00:51:24.933
I don't know.

00:51:24.967 --> 00:51:28.403
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

00:51:29.305 --> 00:51:31.773
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

00:51:31.807 --> 00:51:33.275
- Liar liar liar!
- Arya!

00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:35.610
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar liar liar!

00:51:35.645 --> 00:51:40.006
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

00:51:40.083 --> 00:51:41.104
I want her punished.

00:51:41.105 --> 00:51:43.837
What would you have me do,
whip her through the streets?

00:51:44.359 --> 00:51:47.061
Damn it, children fight.
It's over.

00:51:47.097 --> 00:51:49.699
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

00:51:51.368 --> 00:51:55.004
You let that
little girl disarm you?

00:52:01.011 --> 00:52:04.147
Ned, see to it that
your daughter is disciplined.

00:52:04.181 --> 00:52:07.050
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

00:52:08.285 --> 00:52:10.920
And what of the direwolf?

00:52:10.955 --> 00:52:13.556
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

00:52:16.427 --> 00:52:18.928
I'd forgot
the damned wolf.

00:52:18.963 --> 00:52:21.731
We found no trace
of the direwolf, Your Grace.

00:52:21.765 --> 00:52:25.034
No?
So be it.

00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:27.237
We have another wolf.

00:52:30.541 --> 00:52:32.175
As you will.

00:52:32.209 --> 00:52:35.411
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

00:52:35.446 --> 00:52:37.881
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

00:52:39.016 --> 00:52:41.384
He doesn't mean Lady,
does he?

00:52:41.418 --> 00:52:44.420
No no, not lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

00:52:44.455 --> 00:52:46.356
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:49.759
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

00:52:49.827 --> 00:52:52.562
Please please,
it wasn't Lady!

00:52:52.596 --> 00:52:54.097
Is this your command--

00:52:55.165 --> 00:52:56.699
Your Grace?

00:53:03.107 --> 00:53:06.643
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

00:53:06.677 --> 00:53:08.845
Ser Ilyn,
do me the honor.

00:53:08.879 --> 00:53:11.180
No.

00:53:11.215 --> 00:53:13.583
Jory...

00:53:14.685 --> 00:53:16.719
Take the girls
to their rooms.

00:53:20.925 --> 00:53:23.526
If it must be done,

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.528
then I'll do it myself.

00:53:25.562 --> 00:53:27.764
Is this some trick?

00:53:27.798 --> 00:53:30.733
The wolf is of the north.

00:53:30.768 --> 00:53:33.870
She deserves better
than a butcher.

00:54:07.237 --> 00:54:09.172
The butcher's boy--

00:54:09.239 --> 00:54:10.907
you rode him down?

00:54:10.941 --> 00:54:13.076
He ran...

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:14.811
Not very fast.

00:55:45.326 --> 00:55:49.326
