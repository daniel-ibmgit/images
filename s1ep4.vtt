WEBVTT

00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:01.691
Tell them all to stop.

00:00:01.716 --> 00:00:02.700
For how long?

00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:04.669
Until I command them otherwise.

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:06.205
You're learning to talk like a Queen.

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.942
Not a Queen.
A Khaleesi.

00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:13.414
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle

00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:15.783
spitting down on the likes of you.

00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:17.818
Everybody knew
what this place was,

00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:20.454
but no one told me—
no one but you.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.489
The Khaleesi have baby inside her.

00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:24.859
It is true.
Her belly start to swell.

00:00:24.893 --> 00:00:27.429
I need to ride to Qohor.

00:00:27.463 --> 00:00:29.198
What did Aaerys Targaryen say

00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:31.535
when you stabbed him in the back?

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.005
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours—

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.540
"Burn them all."

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:37.942
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:40.978
in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

00:00:41.012 --> 00:00:43.549
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot afford.

00:00:43.584 --> 00:00:46.052
I'm leaving this morning.
My job is out there.

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:48.389
- I won't let you down.
- You're not going.

00:00:48.424 --> 00:00:51.893
Here, a man gets what he earns
when he earns it.

00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:55.731
I don't take orders
from savages or their sluts.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.669
I don't want my brother harmed.

00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:03.739
Mormont, kill these Dothraki dogs!

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:08.210
We've come to a dangerous place.
We must protect ourselves.

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:10.746
Ah!

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.414
We allow the Northerners
too much power.

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:14.416
A good King knows
when to save his strength

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.518
and when to destroy his enemies.

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:18.787
So you agree...
The Starks are enemies?

00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:22.324
Everyone who isn't us
is an enemy.

00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:25.262
- Do you know whose dagger this is?
- I do.

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:27.631
Tyrion Lannister's...

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:30.000
The Imp.

00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:13.921
The little lord's
been dreaming again.

00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:23.530
- We have visitors.
- I don't want to see anyone.

00:04:23.565 --> 00:04:26.567
Really?
If I was cooped up all day

00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:29.670
with no one but this old bat
for company, I'd go mad.

00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:33.274
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

00:04:33.308 --> 00:04:36.310
- I don't want to go.
- Neither do I.

00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:38.246
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.416
which means I do what he says,
and you do what I say.

00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:45.153
Hodor!

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.192
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

00:04:51.227 --> 00:04:53.328
Hodor.

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.972
I must say I received a slightly
warmer welcome on my last visit.

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:05.508
Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

00:05:05.543 --> 00:05:08.745
Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not I, eh, boy?

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.714
I'm not your boy, Lannister.

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:12.717
I'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:16.254
Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.

00:05:18.324 --> 00:05:20.192
So it's true.

00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:24.295
Hello, Bran.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.664
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

00:05:26.698 --> 00:05:29.300
He has no memory of that day.

00:05:29.334 --> 00:05:31.768
- Curious.
- Why are you here

00:05:31.802 --> 00:05:35.971
would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:39.741
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:44.980
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

00:05:45.014 --> 00:05:47.416
Well, I mean I did like to.

00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:49.686
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.988
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

00:05:52.023 --> 00:05:55.059
- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.

00:05:55.093 --> 00:05:57.128
My father will
rejoice to hear it.

00:05:57.162 --> 00:05:59.764
I have a gift for you.

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:02.334
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

00:06:04.503 --> 00:06:06.938
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

00:06:06.972 --> 00:06:09.040
Start with a yearling
and teach it to respond

00:06:09.074 --> 00:06:11.008
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:13.944
Will I really be able to ride?

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.546
You will.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.914
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

00:06:17.948 --> 00:06:21.217
Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:22.952
I have a tender spot in my heart

00:06:22.987 --> 00:06:25.889
for cripples, bastards
and broken things.

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:29.026
You've done my brother
a kindness.

00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:31.363
The hospitality
of Winterfell is yours.

00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:34.232
Spare me your false courtesies,
Lord Stark.

00:06:34.266 --> 00:06:36.468
There's a brothel
outside your walls.

00:06:36.502 --> 00:06:39.404
There I'll find a bed and both
of us can sleep easier.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.079
Couldn't resist
some Northern ass?

00:06:47.113 --> 00:06:49.882
If you like redheads,
ask for Ros.

00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:52.785
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.354
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

00:06:55.388 --> 00:06:58.324
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

00:06:58.358 --> 00:07:00.326
What happened here?

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.728
Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

00:07:02.762 --> 00:07:05.631
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

00:07:05.665 --> 00:07:07.866
- Where did she go?
- My Lady's whereabouts—

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.568
My Lady?

00:07:09.603 --> 00:07:13.006
Your loyalty to your captors
is touching.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.242
Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

00:07:16.276 --> 00:07:19.211
if he could see his only
surviving son has turned lackey?

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.581
I still remember seeing
my father's fleet

00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:24.216
burn in Lannisport.

00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:26.152
I believe your uncles
were responsible?

00:07:26.186 --> 00:07:27.454
Must have been a pretty sight.

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.896
Nothing prettier than watching
sailors burn alive.

00:07:30.024 --> 00:07:33.393
Yes, a great victory
for your people.

00:07:33.428 --> 00:07:37.131
- Shame how it all turned out.
- We were outnumbered 10 to one—

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:39.200
A stupid rebellion then.

00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:41.236
I suppose your father
realized that

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.772
when your brothers
died in battle.

00:07:43.806 --> 00:07:47.176
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.044
- Careful, Imp.
- I've offended you.

00:07:49.078 --> 00:07:52.381
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

00:07:52.415 --> 00:07:55.817
Anyway, don't despair.

00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:58.287
I'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:00.055
and I've learned to live with it.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.958
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

00:08:02.993 --> 00:08:06.261
I'll try not to wear her out.

00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:13.535
Shoulder, legs.

00:08:17.907 --> 00:08:21.509
Leg, shoulder, leg.

00:08:22.578 --> 00:08:24.445
Left foot forward.
Good.

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:26.881
Now pivot as you
deliver the stroke.

00:08:26.915 --> 00:08:28.583
Put all your weight behind it.

00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:30.951
What in Seven Hells is that?

00:08:30.986 --> 00:08:33.521
They'll need an eighth hell
to fit him in.

00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:37.725
Tell them your name.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.960
Samwell Tarly,

00:08:39.995 --> 00:08:42.296
of Horn Hill—
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:47.268
- I've come to take the black.
- Come to take the black pudding.

00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:49.884
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

00:08:50.439 --> 00:08:52.106
Rast...

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.342
See what he can do.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.251
I yield.

00:09:05.286 --> 00:09:08.221
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:10.289
Pick up your sword.

00:09:10.324 --> 00:09:12.925
Hit him till he finds his feet.

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:24.704
It seems they've run short of
poachers and thieves down south.

00:09:24.739 --> 00:09:27.607
- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jon!

00:09:27.642 --> 00:09:30.210
Again, harder.

00:09:30.244 --> 00:09:32.112
I yield!

00:09:32.146 --> 00:09:33.647
Enough!

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:36.950
He yielded.

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:40.587
Looks like the bastard's in love.

00:09:43.424 --> 00:09:45.291
All right then, Lord Snow,

00:09:45.325 --> 00:09:48.561
you wish to defend your lady love,
let's make it an exercise.

00:09:48.595 --> 00:09:51.698
You two. Three of you ought
to be sufficient

00:09:51.732 --> 00:09:54.033
to make Lady Piggy squeal.

00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:57.136
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

00:09:59.106 --> 00:10:01.740
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

00:10:15.556 --> 00:10:18.458
Yield yield yield!
I yield.

00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:22.229
We're done for today.

00:10:22.263 --> 00:10:23.997
Go clean the armory.

00:10:24.032 --> 00:10:25.798
That's all you're good for.

00:10:29.703 --> 00:10:32.438
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

00:10:36.242 --> 00:10:37.976
Did he hurt you?

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.211
I've had worse.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.049
You can call me Sam...
If you want.

00:10:44.084 --> 00:10:47.786
- My mother calls me Sam—
- It's not going to get any easier, you know?

00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:50.056
You're going to have
to defend yourself.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.991
Why didn't you get up and fight?

00:10:52.025 --> 00:10:55.328
I wanted to.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.731
- I just couldn't.
- Why not?

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.602
I'm a coward.

00:11:03.405 --> 00:11:06.206
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:08.308
You're right.
I'm sorry.

00:11:08.343 --> 00:11:11.477
I just... wanted
to thank you.

00:11:22.155 --> 00:11:24.190
A bloody coward.

00:11:24.224 --> 00:11:26.292
People saw us talking to him.

00:11:26.326 --> 00:11:28.461
Now they'll think
we're cowards too.

00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:30.195
You're too stupid to be a coward.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.531
- You're too stupid to be a—
- Quick now,

00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:35.234
before summer's over.

00:11:35.268 --> 00:11:37.469
C'mere!

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.200
Hyah hyah!

00:12:11.904 --> 00:12:15.674
Vaes Dothrak—
the city of the horselords.

00:12:17.811 --> 00:12:19.445
A pile of mud.

00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:20.947
Mud and shit and twigs—

00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:24.250
- best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.

00:12:24.284 --> 00:12:26.352
You shouldn't call them savages.

00:12:26.386 --> 00:12:28.487
I'll call them what I like,
because they're my people.

00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:30.856
This is my army.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.292
Khal Drogo is marching the
wrong way with my army.

00:12:53.578 --> 00:12:56.847
If my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

00:12:56.881 --> 00:13:00.617
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

00:13:00.651 --> 00:13:03.353
The Dothraki have never
crossed the Narrow Sea.

00:13:03.387 --> 00:13:06.023
They fear any water
their horses can't drink.

00:13:06.057 --> 00:13:08.392
But if they did?

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:11.929
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

00:13:11.963 --> 00:13:14.898
but the men
advising him are different.

00:13:14.933 --> 00:13:19.135
- And you know these men?
- I fought beside them once,

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.304
long ago.

00:13:21.338 --> 00:13:23.706
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:26.509
He drove me from my land.

00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:29.846
You sold slaves.

00:13:31.048 --> 00:13:33.449
Aye.

00:13:34.318 --> 00:13:37.320
- Why?
- I had no money

00:13:37.354 --> 00:13:39.856
and an expensive wife.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.725
And where is she now?

00:13:41.759 --> 00:13:43.693
In another place,

00:13:43.728 --> 00:13:46.163
with another man.

00:13:51.836 --> 00:13:54.571
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:57.374
They call you the Last Dragon...

00:13:57.408 --> 00:14:00.110
They do.

00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:03.548
You have dragon's blood

00:14:03.582 --> 00:14:05.483
in your veins?

00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:07.552
It's entirely possible.

00:14:07.587 --> 00:14:11.156
What happened to the dragons?

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.859
I was told that brave men
killed them all.

00:14:17.597 --> 00:14:20.232
The brave men
didn't kill dragons.

00:14:20.267 --> 00:14:23.035
The brave men rode them.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:27.473
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

00:14:27.508 --> 00:14:30.043
this world has ever seen.

00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:32.412
The breath of the greatest dragon

00:14:32.446 --> 00:14:34.448
forged the Iron Throne,

00:14:34.482 --> 00:14:37.251
which the Usurper is
keeping warm for me.

00:14:38.553 --> 00:14:41.088
The swords of the vanquished,

00:14:41.123 --> 00:14:43.923
a thousand of them...

00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:48.328
Melted together
like so many candles.

00:14:51.631 --> 00:14:54.733
I have always wanted
to see a dragon.

00:14:56.369 --> 00:14:59.270
There is nothing in the world
that I would rather see.

00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:01.472
Really.
Why dragons?

00:15:01.506 --> 00:15:04.208
They can fly.

00:15:04.243 --> 00:15:07.346
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.982
and they're somewhere else...

00:15:10.017 --> 00:15:12.151
Far away.

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.957
And they can kill.

00:15:16.991 --> 00:15:21.562
Anyone or anything that
tries to hurt them

00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:26.600
gets burned away to nothing...

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:30.203
...Like so many candles.

00:15:30.238 --> 00:15:31.404
Ow.

00:15:34.007 --> 00:15:36.342
Yes.
Seeing a dragon

00:15:36.376 --> 00:15:38.310
would make me very happy.

00:15:38.344 --> 00:15:40.913
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

00:15:40.947 --> 00:15:43.148
I imagine just seeing
the sky makes you happy.

00:15:43.183 --> 00:15:46.251
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.

00:15:46.286 --> 00:15:48.254
- What have you seen?
- I've seen...

00:15:48.288 --> 00:15:52.058
A man from Asshai with a dagger
of real dragonglass.

00:15:52.093 --> 00:15:54.228
- Ooh.
- I've seen a man who could

00:15:54.262 --> 00:15:58.667
change his face the way that
other men change their clothes.

00:15:58.701 --> 00:16:02.705
And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

00:16:02.739 --> 00:16:06.875
and whose ship had
sails of colored silk.

00:16:06.909 --> 00:16:11.347
So...

00:16:11.381 --> 00:16:13.549
Have you seen one?

00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:17.086
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:20.088
No.

00:16:20.123 --> 00:16:23.593
No, the last one died many years
before I was born.

00:16:23.627 --> 00:16:26.962
I'll tell you what I have seen:

00:16:26.997 --> 00:16:29.565
Their skulls.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.736
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.172
When I was very young,
just three or four,

00:16:35.206 --> 00:16:37.408
my father used
to walk me down the rows

00:16:37.442 --> 00:16:39.176
and I'd recite
their names for him.

00:16:39.211 --> 00:16:42.047
When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

00:16:43.716 --> 00:16:46.851
The ones closest to the door were
the last ones they were able to hatch

00:16:46.885 --> 00:16:48.686
and they were all
stunted and wrong.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.990
Skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

00:16:52.024 --> 00:16:56.962
But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

00:16:58.298 --> 00:17:00.332
They got bigger

00:17:00.367 --> 00:17:03.435
and bigger and bigger.

00:17:06.239 --> 00:17:08.740
There was Ghiscar

00:17:08.775 --> 00:17:11.343
and Valryon,

00:17:11.377 --> 00:17:13.144
Vermithrax,

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:15.513
Essovius—

00:17:15.548 --> 00:17:18.049
Archonei,

00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:21.052
Meraxes,

00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:24.555
Vhagar...

00:17:26.159 --> 00:17:28.961
And Balerion the Dread...

00:17:28.995 --> 00:17:31.563
...Whose fire forged

00:17:31.598 --> 00:17:33.700
the Seven Kingdoms

00:17:33.734 --> 00:17:35.969
into one.

00:17:40.442 --> 00:17:43.177
What happened to the skulls?

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:47.048
I don't know.

00:17:47.082 --> 00:17:50.384
The Usurper had them
smashed to powder, I expect.

00:17:51.253 --> 00:17:53.488
Scattered to the wind.

00:17:56.491 --> 00:17:59.226
That's very sad.

00:17:59.261 --> 00:18:01.095
Yes, it is.

00:18:02.697 --> 00:18:04.898
What did I buy you for?

00:18:04.932 --> 00:18:08.001
- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.

00:18:09.103 --> 00:18:12.438
To, uh, teach your sister.

00:18:12.473 --> 00:18:14.873
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

00:18:14.908 --> 00:18:18.810
You think I bought you to make
Khal Drogo happy?

00:18:23.249 --> 00:18:26.252
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

00:18:28.288 --> 00:18:30.423
Go on then.
Get on with it.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.935
Someday your husband
will sit there

00:18:42.969 --> 00:18:45.237
and you will sit by his side.

00:18:45.272 --> 00:18:50.410
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

00:18:50.444 --> 00:18:53.012
All the Lords of Westeros

00:18:53.047 --> 00:18:55.782
will gather here to see
the little prince—

00:18:55.816 --> 00:18:57.617
What if I have a girl?

00:18:57.652 --> 00:19:00.587
Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

00:19:00.621 --> 00:19:03.222
What if I only have girls?

00:19:03.257 --> 00:19:05.392
I wouldn't worry about that.

00:19:05.426 --> 00:19:08.494
Jeyne Poole's mother had five children—
all of them girls.

00:19:08.528 --> 00:19:10.630
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

00:19:10.664 --> 00:19:13.166
But what if?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.402
Well, if you only had girls,

00:19:16.437 --> 00:19:20.006
I suppose the throne would
pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.976
And everyone would hate me.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.111
Nobody could ever hate you.

00:19:25.146 --> 00:19:27.648
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

00:19:27.682 --> 00:19:30.717
Why would you say such a thing?

00:19:32.186 --> 00:19:34.321
That business with the wolves?
Sansa,

00:19:34.355 --> 00:19:36.757
I've told you a hundred times:

00:19:36.791 --> 00:19:39.526
- A direwolf is not—
- Please shut up about it.

00:19:40.928 --> 00:19:42.729
Do you remember your lessons?

00:19:44.532 --> 00:19:47.301
Who built the Iron Throne?

00:19:47.335 --> 00:19:49.403
Aegon the Conqueror.

00:19:49.437 --> 00:19:51.472
And who built the Red Keep?

00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:53.073
Maegor the Cruel.

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:54.975
And how many years
did it take to build—

00:19:55.009 --> 00:19:58.045
My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

00:19:59.547 --> 00:20:02.782
They were killed on the orders of
King Aerys, yes.

00:20:02.817 --> 00:20:07.120
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

00:20:07.154 --> 00:20:09.588
Why were they killed?

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.858
You should be speak to your
father about these matters.

00:20:13.893 --> 00:20:15.893
I don't want to speak
to my father— ever.

00:20:15.928 --> 00:20:19.397
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

00:20:19.431 --> 00:20:20.932
to forgive your father.

00:20:20.966 --> 00:20:22.733
No, I won't.

00:20:22.767 --> 00:20:25.035
It's the Hand's
tournament that's causing

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.738
- all this trouble, My Lords.
- The King's tournament.

00:20:27.773 --> 00:20:31.408
I assure you the Hand
wants no part of it.

00:20:31.443 --> 00:20:33.677
Call it what you will,
Lord Stark, Ser,

00:20:33.712 --> 00:20:36.980
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

00:20:37.015 --> 00:20:40.183
Last night we had a tavern riot,
a brothel fire,

00:20:40.217 --> 00:20:43.120
three stabbings and a drunken horse race
down the Street of Sisters.

00:20:43.154 --> 00:20:45.989
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the King's peace,

00:20:46.024 --> 00:20:49.059
perhaps the City Watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

00:20:49.094 --> 00:20:50.794
- I need more men.
- You'll get 50.

00:20:50.828 --> 00:20:53.764
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- I will?

00:20:53.798 --> 00:20:55.499
You found money
for a champion's purse,

00:20:55.533 --> 00:20:57.434
you can find money
to keep the peace.

00:20:59.237 --> 00:21:01.305
I'll also give you
20 of my household guard

00:21:01.339 --> 00:21:03.139
till the crowds have left.

00:21:03.173 --> 00:21:04.808
Thank you, My Lord Hand, Ser.

00:21:04.842 --> 00:21:06.576
They will be put to good use.

00:21:08.812 --> 00:21:10.847
The sooner this is over,
the better.

00:21:10.881 --> 00:21:13.850
The realm prospers
from such events, My Lord.

00:21:13.884 --> 00:21:16.052
They give the great
a chance at glory,

00:21:16.086 --> 00:21:18.354
and the lowly a respite
from their woes.

00:21:18.389 --> 00:21:20.824
And every inn in the city is full

00:21:20.858 --> 00:21:22.892
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

00:21:22.927 --> 00:21:25.395
I'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

00:21:25.429 --> 00:21:27.964
- Hmmm.
- Now...

00:21:27.999 --> 00:21:30.567
If there's nothing else,
My Lords?

00:21:40.111 --> 00:21:42.612
Oh, this heat.

00:21:42.647 --> 00:21:45.448
On days like this,
I envy you Northerners

00:21:45.483 --> 00:21:47.217
your summer snows.

00:21:47.258 --> 00:21:48.265
Until tomorrow, My Lord—

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.662
I've been hoping to talk
to you about Jon Arryn.

00:21:50.855 --> 00:21:53.723
Lord Arryn?

00:21:53.757 --> 00:21:55.925
Oh, his death was

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.694
a great sadness to all of us.

00:21:58.729 --> 00:22:00.963
I took personal charge
of his care,

00:22:00.997 --> 00:22:03.666
but I could not save him.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.969
His sickness struck him

00:22:06.003 --> 00:22:09.439
very hard and very fast.

00:22:10.341 --> 00:22:12.009
I saw him in my chambers

00:22:12.043 --> 00:22:13.978
just the night before he passed.

00:22:14.012 --> 00:22:17.181
Lord Jon often came
to me for counsel.

00:22:17.216 --> 00:22:19.952
Why?

00:22:19.986 --> 00:22:23.555
I have been Grand Maester for many years.

00:22:23.589 --> 00:22:27.025
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since—

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.962
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

00:22:29.996 --> 00:22:32.431
Oh, he came inquiring
after a book.

00:22:32.465 --> 00:22:34.200
A book?

00:22:34.234 --> 00:22:35.868
What book?

00:22:35.902 --> 00:22:37.603
Oh, I fear

00:22:37.638 --> 00:22:40.407
it would be of little interest
to you, My Lord.

00:22:40.441 --> 00:22:42.909
A ponderous tome.

00:22:42.944 --> 00:22:46.513
No, I'd like to read it.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.519
"The Lineages and Histories

00:22:51.553 --> 00:22:54.723
of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

00:22:54.757 --> 00:22:58.427
with descriptions
of many high lords

00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:01.564
and noble ladies

00:23:01.598 --> 00:23:03.732
and their children."

00:23:20.914 --> 00:23:23.316
"Harkon Umber, first of his name,

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.153
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

00:23:27.187 --> 00:23:29.722
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's Landing,

00:23:29.757 --> 00:23:33.060
at the last hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

00:23:33.094 --> 00:23:36.597
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

00:23:36.632 --> 00:23:38.867
of a wound sustained
in a bear hunt."

00:23:38.901 --> 00:23:42.671
As I said, My Lord,
a ponderous read.

00:23:42.705 --> 00:23:45.540
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

00:23:45.574 --> 00:23:48.343
He did not, My Lord.
And I did not presume to ask.

00:23:48.377 --> 00:23:51.011
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:53.380
...Did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

00:23:53.415 --> 00:23:55.215
Nothing of import, My Lord.

00:23:55.249 --> 00:23:58.051
Oh— there was one phrase

00:23:58.085 --> 00:23:59.919
he kept repeating:

00:23:59.953 --> 00:24:03.422
"The seed is strong,"
I think it was.

00:24:03.457 --> 00:24:05.759
- "The seed is strong"?
- Mm.

00:24:05.793 --> 00:24:08.028
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

00:24:08.063 --> 00:24:11.165
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.701
For all the weight they're given,

00:24:13.736 --> 00:24:15.804
last words are usually

00:24:15.838 --> 00:24:17.907
as significant as first words.

00:24:17.941 --> 00:24:20.876
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

00:24:20.911 --> 00:24:23.212
What else could it be?

00:24:24.114 --> 00:24:25.748
Poison.

00:24:25.782 --> 00:24:28.451
A disturbing thought.

00:24:28.485 --> 00:24:30.653
No no no, I don't
think it likely.

00:24:30.687 --> 00:24:33.088
The Hand was loved by all.

00:24:33.123 --> 00:24:35.124
What sort of man would dare—

00:24:35.158 --> 00:24:38.027
I've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:40.529
Yes, women,

00:24:40.564 --> 00:24:42.464
cravens...

00:24:42.498 --> 00:24:45.166
And eunuchs.

00:24:45.201 --> 00:24:48.604
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

00:24:48.638 --> 00:24:50.105
Everybody knows that.

00:24:50.139 --> 00:24:52.374
Yes yes, of course.

00:24:52.408 --> 00:24:55.844
How that sort of person
found himself

00:24:55.879 --> 00:24:58.513
on the King's Council,
I will never know.

00:24:58.548 --> 00:25:00.248
I've taken enough of your time.

00:25:00.283 --> 00:25:02.885
No trouble at all, My Lord.
It's a great honor—

00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:04.653
Thank you.

00:25:04.688 --> 00:25:06.622
I'll find my own way out.

00:25:29.148 --> 00:25:31.183
Syrio says a water dancer

00:25:31.217 --> 00:25:32.917
can stand on one toe for hours.

00:25:32.952 --> 00:25:35.754
It's a hard fall
down these steps.

00:25:35.788 --> 00:25:37.756
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson

00:25:37.791 --> 00:25:39.992
and every lesson
makes you better.

00:25:41.528 --> 00:25:44.530
- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats?

00:25:44.565 --> 00:25:46.065
Syrio says.

00:25:46.099 --> 00:25:48.167
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

00:25:48.202 --> 00:25:51.238
They're quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

00:25:51.272 --> 00:25:53.540
You have to be
quick to catch them.

00:25:53.575 --> 00:25:55.410
He's right about that.

00:25:55.444 --> 00:25:56.878
Now that Bran's awake

00:25:56.912 --> 00:25:59.715
will he come live with us?

00:26:01.484 --> 00:26:04.687
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

00:26:04.721 --> 00:26:07.189
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

00:26:07.223 --> 00:26:11.594
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.564
But someday

00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:17.900
he could be Lord of a holdfast

00:26:17.934 --> 00:26:20.168
or sit on the King's Council.

00:26:20.203 --> 00:26:22.605
Or he might raise castles

00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:25.173
like Brandon the Builder.

00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:27.943
Can I be Lord of a holdfast?

00:26:32.314 --> 00:26:35.316
You will marry a high lord

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.351
and rule his castle.

00:26:37.385 --> 00:26:39.752
And your sons shall be knights

00:26:39.787 --> 00:26:42.388
and princes and lords.

00:26:43.791 --> 00:26:46.459
- Hmm?
- No.

00:26:47.394 --> 00:26:49.862
That's not me.

00:27:11.987 --> 00:27:14.121
Hello.

00:27:15.624 --> 00:27:18.225
Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new watch partner.

00:27:20.395 --> 00:27:21.929
I should warn you,

00:27:21.963 --> 00:27:24.832
I don't see all that well.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.002
Come stand by the fire.

00:27:29.371 --> 00:27:31.606
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.008
You're not.
You're freezing.

00:27:45.854 --> 00:27:48.790
I don't like high places.

00:27:48.825 --> 00:27:50.559
You can't fight.

00:27:50.593 --> 00:27:52.361
You can't see.

00:27:52.396 --> 00:27:55.732
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

00:27:57.435 --> 00:27:59.369
What are you doing here, Sam?

00:28:03.742 --> 00:28:07.444
On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.048
"You're almost
a man now," he said...

00:28:12.384 --> 00:28:15.619
"But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

00:28:16.888 --> 00:28:19.190
Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

00:28:19.224 --> 00:28:22.526
forsake all claim to your
inheritance and start North.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.964
If you do not," he said...

00:28:27.932 --> 00:28:30.133
"Then we'll have a hunt

00:28:30.168 --> 00:28:33.203
and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

00:28:33.237 --> 00:28:36.073
and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

00:28:38.576 --> 00:28:41.111
Or so I'll tell your mother.

00:28:41.146 --> 00:28:43.313
Nothing would
please me more."

00:28:48.486 --> 00:28:51.588
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

00:28:52.757 --> 00:28:54.892
Yes, he is.

00:28:54.926 --> 00:28:57.695
I'm not going to get
any better, you know?

00:28:59.131 --> 00:29:01.032
Well...

00:29:01.066 --> 00:29:02.867
You can't get any worse.

00:29:12.643 --> 00:29:15.444
I hear you're reading
a boring book.

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:17.279
Hmph.

00:29:17.314 --> 00:29:19.448
Pycelle talks too much.

00:29:19.482 --> 00:29:21.383
Oh, he never stops.

00:29:21.417 --> 00:29:23.918
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

00:29:25.054 --> 00:29:27.455
Not surprising.
Until recently,

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:31.025
he was only a squire—
Jon Arryn's squire.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.027
He was knighted
almost immediately

00:29:33.062 --> 00:29:35.463
after his master's
untimely death.

00:29:35.497 --> 00:29:37.799
Knighted for what?

00:29:38.767 --> 00:29:40.401
Why are you telling me this?

00:29:40.435 --> 00:29:42.136
I promised Cat that I'd help you.

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.638
Where is Ser Hugh?

00:29:44.673 --> 00:29:47.574
- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

00:29:47.609 --> 00:29:49.776
Do you see that boy there?

00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:52.445
One of Varys's little birds.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.282
The Spider has taken a great
interest in your comings and goings.

00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:58.217
Now look there.

00:29:58.252 --> 00:30:00.986
That one belongs to the Queen.

00:30:01.021 --> 00:30:04.156
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.058
Varys or the Queen?

00:30:07.092 --> 00:30:09.794
No, she's one of mine.

00:30:11.496 --> 00:30:14.731
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.236
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, My Lord.

00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:24.274
Get a message to
this paragon of yours—

00:30:24.308 --> 00:30:27.477
discreetly—
send him to question Ser Hugh.

00:30:27.511 --> 00:30:31.749
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armorer in the city.

00:30:31.783 --> 00:30:35.386
He lives in a large house at the top
of the Street of Steel.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.822
- Why?
- I have my observers, as I said,

00:30:37.857 --> 00:30:40.358
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

00:30:40.393 --> 00:30:44.296
visit this armorer several times
in the weeks before his death.

00:30:45.898 --> 00:30:48.933
Lord Baelish, perhaps I was
wrong to distrust you.

00:30:48.968 --> 00:30:50.835
Distrusting me was
the wisest thing

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.471
you've done since you climbed
off your horse.

00:30:59.944 --> 00:31:03.079
...Two, three,

00:31:03.113 --> 00:31:04.914
24, five,

00:31:04.949 --> 00:31:07.250
six, 27,

00:31:07.284 --> 00:31:09.285
- 28, 29—
- Ser Hugh?

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.988
30, 31, 32...

00:31:11.022 --> 00:31:13.290
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.

00:31:13.324 --> 00:31:16.260
I'm here on behalf
of Lord Eddard Stark,

00:31:16.295 --> 00:31:18.563
the Hand of the King.

00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:19.997
I'm the Captain of his guard.

00:31:20.032 --> 00:31:22.200
I'm sorry, I didn't catch
your name, Ser...

00:31:22.234 --> 00:31:24.903
No "Ser."
I'm not a knight.

00:31:24.937 --> 00:31:28.239
I see. Well, it just
so happens that I am.

00:31:32.977 --> 00:31:35.946
He said he'd be glad
to talk to the Hand himself.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.814
He's a knight, you see.

00:31:37.848 --> 00:31:39.582
Ah, a knight.

00:31:39.616 --> 00:31:42.484
They strut around
like roosters down here.

00:31:42.519 --> 00:31:46.188
Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.

00:31:46.222 --> 00:31:48.090
You shouldn't be
out here, My Lord.

00:31:48.124 --> 00:31:51.560
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

00:31:53.563 --> 00:31:56.398
The former Hand did call on me,
My Lord, several times.

00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:59.768
I regret to say he did not honor me
with his patronage.

00:31:59.803 --> 00:32:02.337
What did Lord Arryn want?

00:32:02.372 --> 00:32:04.439
He always came to see the boy.

00:32:04.474 --> 00:32:06.375
I'd like to see him as well.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.745
As you wish! My lord.

00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:16.116
Here he is.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.785
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

00:32:18.819 --> 00:32:21.955
Show the hand
the helmet you made, lad.

00:32:35.804 --> 00:32:38.573
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

00:32:38.607 --> 00:32:40.508
Boy, this is the King's Hand!

00:32:40.543 --> 00:32:43.946
- If his lordship wants the helm—
- I made it for me.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.615
- Forgive him, My Lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

00:32:48.117 --> 00:32:50.852
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

00:32:50.886 --> 00:32:53.388
He just asked me questions
is all, My Lord.

00:32:53.422 --> 00:32:55.590
What kind of questions?

00:32:57.693 --> 00:32:59.994
About my work at first,

00:33:00.028 --> 00:33:03.631
if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.

00:33:05.367 --> 00:33:07.602
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

00:33:08.971 --> 00:33:12.039
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

00:33:12.975 --> 00:33:14.809
What did you tell him?

00:33:16.512 --> 00:33:18.580
She died when I was little.

00:33:18.614 --> 00:33:20.848
She had yellow hair.

00:33:20.883 --> 00:33:23.518
She'd sing to me sometimes.

00:33:27.423 --> 00:33:29.291
Look at me.

00:33:39.002 --> 00:33:40.937
Get back to work, lad.

00:33:42.673 --> 00:33:44.674
If the day ever comes
when that boy

00:33:44.708 --> 00:33:46.876
would rather wield
a sword than forge one,

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.311
you send him to me.

00:33:54.084 --> 00:33:56.118
Find anything?

00:33:57.154 --> 00:33:59.955
King Robert's bastard son.

00:34:02.325 --> 00:34:05.027
He likes that.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.366
This is for the King
from Lord Stark.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.635
Should I leave it with—

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.404
Shhh.

00:34:13.438 --> 00:34:15.273
Listen.

00:34:15.307 --> 00:34:18.043
Do you hear them?

00:34:20.347 --> 00:34:22.581
How many do you think
are in there with him?

00:34:22.615 --> 00:34:24.416
Huh?

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:26.251
- Guess.
- Three?

00:34:26.285 --> 00:34:28.586
Four.

00:34:30.288 --> 00:34:32.557
He likes to do this
when I'm on duty—

00:34:32.591 --> 00:34:35.159
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

00:34:40.866 --> 00:34:41.689
Forgive me, My Lord—

00:34:41.714 --> 00:34:43.715
Why do I have to forgive you?
Have you wronged me?

00:34:46.237 --> 00:34:48.038
We've met before, you know.

00:34:48.073 --> 00:34:51.042
Have we?
Strange, I've forgotten.

00:34:51.076 --> 00:34:54.513
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

00:34:54.547 --> 00:34:56.348
Ah.

00:34:56.382 --> 00:34:58.417
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

00:34:58.451 --> 00:34:59.852
Oh.

00:34:59.887 --> 00:35:01.721
One of the Greyjoys
nearly took my eye.

00:35:01.756 --> 00:35:04.725
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

00:35:04.759 --> 00:35:06.927
They stopped liking it
at the end.

00:35:06.961 --> 00:35:10.964
That was a proper battle.
Do you remember

00:35:10.999 --> 00:35:14.034
Thoros of Myr charging
through the breach?

00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:15.602
With his burning sword?

00:35:15.637 --> 00:35:17.505
I'll remember that
till the day I die.

00:35:17.539 --> 00:35:21.376
I saw the youngest of the
Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.778
It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

00:35:23.812 --> 00:35:26.080
Theon?
He's a good lad.

00:35:26.115 --> 00:35:27.215
I doubt it.

00:35:32.055 --> 00:35:34.590
I'll bet you smell
of blackberry jam!

00:35:34.625 --> 00:35:36.993
Let me smell it.
Come here.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.530
Can I leave this with you?

00:35:40.565 --> 00:35:42.199
The message from Lord Stark.

00:35:42.233 --> 00:35:44.568
I don't serve Lord Stark.

00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:10.125
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:12.527
- With Sam.
- Ah, Prince Porkchop.

00:36:12.562 --> 00:36:14.696
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

00:36:14.731 --> 00:36:16.398
Impossible!

00:36:16.432 --> 00:36:18.968
That's enough.

00:36:24.175 --> 00:36:26.576
Sam's no different
from the rest of us.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.912
There was no place
for him in the world,

00:36:28.946 --> 00:36:30.746
so he's come here.

00:36:30.781 --> 00:36:33.216
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.118
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

00:36:36.152 --> 00:36:39.121
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:41.823
You are in love, Lord Snow.

00:36:44.293 --> 00:36:47.262
You girls can do as you please.

00:36:47.296 --> 00:36:50.132
But if Thorne puts me
up against Lady Piggy,

00:36:50.167 --> 00:36:52.234
I'm gonna slice me off
a side of bacon.

00:37:15.294 --> 00:37:17.996
No one touches Sam.

00:37:32.278 --> 00:37:34.613
What are you waiting for?

00:37:44.524 --> 00:37:46.925
Attack him!

00:37:55.835 --> 00:37:58.136
You get in there.

00:38:02.108 --> 00:38:03.608
Hit me.

00:38:05.811 --> 00:38:07.812
Go on, hit me!

00:38:09.748 --> 00:38:12.350
I yield!

00:38:12.384 --> 00:38:14.352
Yield yield.

00:38:14.386 --> 00:38:16.620
I yield.

00:38:19.491 --> 00:38:22.493
You think this is funny, do you?

00:38:25.598 --> 00:38:27.098
When you're out there

00:38:27.133 --> 00:38:29.834
beyond the Wall
with the sun going down,

00:38:29.869 --> 00:38:32.304
do you want a man at your back?

00:38:32.338 --> 00:38:34.640
Or a sniveling boy?

00:38:49.089 --> 00:38:51.857
You send this whore
to give me commands?

00:38:51.892 --> 00:38:54.426
I should have sent
you back her head!

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.361
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.

00:38:56.396 --> 00:38:57.996
Hush now.
It's all right.

00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:01.333
- Irri, take her and leave us.
- Yes, Khaleesi.

00:39:04.671 --> 00:39:07.739
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do I have to tell you?

00:39:07.774 --> 00:39:09.374
You do not command me.

00:39:09.409 --> 00:39:11.175
I wasn't commanding you.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.010
I just wanted to invite
you to supper.

00:39:13.045 --> 00:39:15.313
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

00:39:15.347 --> 00:39:18.283
- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

00:39:18.317 --> 00:39:20.351
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

00:39:20.386 --> 00:39:22.420
This stinks of manure.
All of it.

00:39:22.455 --> 00:39:24.826
Stop— stop it.

00:39:24.851 --> 00:39:26.321
You would turn me into one
of them, wouldn't you?

00:39:26.325 --> 00:39:27.992
Next you'll want
to braid my hair.

00:39:28.026 --> 00:39:30.060
You've no right to a braid.

00:39:30.094 --> 00:39:31.561
You've won no victories yet.

00:39:31.596 --> 00:39:34.731
You do not talk back to me!

00:39:36.033 --> 00:39:38.534
You are a horselord's slut.

00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:40.503
And now you've woken the dragon—

00:39:46.143 --> 00:39:49.713
I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki!

00:39:49.747 --> 00:39:52.116
I am the wife of the great Khal

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.919
and I carry his son inside me.

00:39:54.953 --> 00:39:58.723
The next time
you raise a hand to me

00:39:58.757 --> 00:40:01.993
will be the last time
you have hands.

00:40:09.802 --> 00:40:11.703
I know for a fact
that some of the officers

00:40:11.738 --> 00:40:13.705
go to that brothel
in Mole's Town.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.540
I wouldn't doubt it.

00:40:15.575 --> 00:40:18.009
Don't you think it's
a little bit unfair?

00:40:18.043 --> 00:40:20.178
Making us take our vows
while they sneak off

00:40:20.212 --> 00:40:22.813
for a little Sally on the side?

00:40:22.847 --> 00:40:25.616
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.987
What, we can't defend
the Wall unless we're celibate?

00:40:29.021 --> 00:40:30.844
It's absurd.

00:40:30.869 --> 00:40:32.923
I didn't think you'd be
so upset about it.

00:40:34.327 --> 00:40:36.595
Why not?

00:40:36.629 --> 00:40:39.090
- Because I'm fat?
- No.

00:40:39.098 --> 00:40:42.210
But I like girls just
as much as you do.

00:40:43.337 --> 00:40:45.906
They might not like me as much.

00:40:47.842 --> 00:40:51.111
I've never— been with one.

00:40:52.446 --> 00:40:54.381
You've probably had hundreds.

00:40:54.415 --> 00:40:56.083
No.

00:40:58.386 --> 00:41:00.921
As a matter of fact,

00:41:00.956 --> 00:41:02.389
I'm the same as you.

00:41:02.424 --> 00:41:04.424
Yeah.

00:41:04.459 --> 00:41:06.660
I find that hard to believe.

00:41:06.694 --> 00:41:08.996
I came very close once.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:12.465
I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but—

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.801
You didn't know where to put it?

00:41:14.835 --> 00:41:16.869
I know where to put it.

00:41:16.904 --> 00:41:18.938
Was she...

00:41:18.973 --> 00:41:21.107
Old and ugly?

00:41:22.142 --> 00:41:23.909
Young and gorgeous.

00:41:25.545 --> 00:41:27.446
A whore named Ros.

00:41:29.415 --> 00:41:31.216
What color hair?

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:34.085
- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.

00:41:35.654 --> 00:41:37.421
And her, um...

00:41:37.456 --> 00:41:39.156
Her...

00:41:40.258 --> 00:41:41.858
- You don't want to know.
- That good?

00:41:41.893 --> 00:41:43.660
- Better.
- Oh no.

00:41:45.363 --> 00:41:47.999
So why exactly

00:41:48.033 --> 00:41:51.736
did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect—?

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.239
What's my name?

00:41:54.273 --> 00:41:56.175
Jon Snow?

00:41:56.209 --> 00:41:59.512
And why is my surname snow?

00:41:59.546 --> 00:42:02.349
Because...

00:42:02.383 --> 00:42:04.951
You're a bastard from the North.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:09.022
I never met my mother.

00:42:09.056 --> 00:42:12.024
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

00:42:12.059 --> 00:42:14.694
I don't know if she's
living or dead.

00:42:16.697 --> 00:42:19.164
I don't know
if she's a noblewoman

00:42:19.199 --> 00:42:20.833
or a fisherman's wife...

00:42:22.535 --> 00:42:24.536
Or a whore.

00:42:26.773 --> 00:42:29.141
So I sat there

00:42:29.175 --> 00:42:32.378
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

00:42:32.412 --> 00:42:35.982
But I couldn't do it.

00:42:36.016 --> 00:42:39.019
Because all I could think was

00:42:39.053 --> 00:42:41.722
what if I got her pregnant

00:42:41.756 --> 00:42:43.791
and she had a child,

00:42:43.825 --> 00:42:46.760
another bastard named Snow?

00:42:51.299 --> 00:42:54.135
It's not a good life for a child.

00:42:54.169 --> 00:42:56.370
Ah, mmm.

00:42:59.174 --> 00:43:01.008
So...

00:43:01.042 --> 00:43:03.444
You didn't know where to put it?

00:43:09.117 --> 00:43:11.252
Enjoying yourselves?

00:43:13.389 --> 00:43:15.190
You look cold, boys.

00:43:16.959 --> 00:43:18.493
It is a bit nippy.

00:43:18.527 --> 00:43:20.929
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

00:43:20.963 --> 00:43:25.100
indoors.
It's still summer.

00:43:26.268 --> 00:43:28.971
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.775
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:34.910
I remember.

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:37.646
Was it uncomfortable
at Winterfell?

00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:40.316
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.185
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.421
- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

00:43:47.957 --> 00:43:50.625
I spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.562
during the last winter.

00:43:53.597 --> 00:43:56.699
It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

00:43:56.734 --> 00:44:00.169
We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:03.573
So we went out to look
for some of his men—

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:06.509
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:09.512
The wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

00:44:09.547 --> 00:44:12.581
Harder than you'll ever be.

00:44:12.616 --> 00:44:15.050
They know their country
better than we do.

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:17.420
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

00:44:18.755 --> 00:44:21.724
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:25.694
And we got caught in the open.

00:44:25.728 --> 00:44:28.030
Wind so strong

00:44:28.064 --> 00:44:30.566
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground,

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.069
roots and all.
If you took your gloves off

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:35.104
to find your cock to have a piss,

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:37.440
you lost a finger to the frost.

00:44:37.474 --> 00:44:39.808
And all in darkness.

00:44:43.046 --> 00:44:45.514
You don't know cold.

00:44:45.548 --> 00:44:47.949
Neither of you do.

00:44:50.086 --> 00:44:52.721
The horses died first.

00:44:54.557 --> 00:44:57.659
We didn't have enough to feed them,
to keep them warm.

00:44:59.929 --> 00:45:02.364
Eating the horses was easy.

00:45:04.333 --> 00:45:07.435
But later when we
started to fall...

00:45:09.171 --> 00:45:11.439
That wasn't easy.

00:45:11.473 --> 00:45:15.008
We should have had a couple of
boys like you along, shouldn't we?

00:45:20.748 --> 00:45:22.982
Soft, fat boys like you.

00:45:23.017 --> 00:45:25.486
We'd have lasted
a fortnight on you

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.556
and still had bones
leftover for soup.

00:45:31.159 --> 00:45:34.062
Soon we'll have new recruits

00:45:34.096 --> 00:45:37.132
and you lot will be passed along
to the Lord Commander

00:45:37.166 --> 00:45:39.301
for assignment

00:45:39.335 --> 00:45:43.272
and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:46.041
but you'd be fools to believe it.

00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:49.478
You're boys still.

00:45:49.512 --> 00:45:52.614
And come the winter
you will die...

00:45:54.416 --> 00:45:56.750
Like flies.

00:46:02.456 --> 00:46:04.825
I hit him.

00:46:04.859 --> 00:46:06.760
I hit the dragon.

00:46:06.795 --> 00:46:09.230
Your brother Rhaegar
was the Last Dragon.

00:46:09.264 --> 00:46:12.167
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

00:46:12.201 --> 00:46:14.069
He is still the true king.

00:46:14.103 --> 00:46:16.104
The truth now:

00:46:16.139 --> 00:46:19.408
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.944
No.

00:46:21.978 --> 00:46:24.880
But the common people
are waiting for him.

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:29.251
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon
banners and praying for his return.

00:46:29.285 --> 00:46:33.421
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

00:46:33.456 --> 00:46:36.924
They don't care what games
the high lords play.

00:46:36.958 --> 00:46:39.793
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

00:46:43.864 --> 00:46:46.833
Home.

00:46:46.867 --> 00:46:49.035
I pray for home too.

00:46:52.373 --> 00:46:55.509
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

00:46:57.178 --> 00:47:00.481
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

00:47:03.852 --> 00:47:06.287
He'll never take us home.

00:47:25.741 --> 00:47:28.109
Lover's quarrel?

00:47:28.144 --> 00:47:29.945
I'm sorry.
Do I...?

00:47:29.979 --> 00:47:33.082
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.
He's known—

00:47:33.117 --> 00:47:34.617
An old friend of the family.

00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:37.855
I've known your mother
a long long time.

00:47:37.889 --> 00:47:40.190
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

00:47:40.225 --> 00:47:43.193
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

00:47:43.228 --> 00:47:46.863
When I was a child
I was very small

00:47:46.898 --> 00:47:49.766
and I come from a little spit of land
called the Fingers,

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.568
so you see,

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:53.669
it's an exceedingly
clever nickname.

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:56.238
I've been sitting here for days!

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:58.273
Start the damn joust

00:47:58.308 --> 00:48:00.242
before I piss myself!

00:48:07.783 --> 00:48:10.352
Gods, who is that?

00:48:10.386 --> 00:48:12.888
Ser Gregor Clegane.

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:16.025
They call him the Mountain.

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:20.130
The Hound's older brother.

00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:23.133
- And his opponent?
- Ser Hugh of the Vale.

00:48:23.168 --> 00:48:25.569
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

00:48:25.603 --> 00:48:27.270
Look how far he's come.

00:48:27.305 --> 00:48:29.539
Yes yes, enough
of the bloody pomp.

00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:31.040
Have at it!

00:49:51.059 --> 00:49:54.095
Not what you were expecting?

00:49:56.933 --> 00:50:00.702
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

00:50:01.905 --> 00:50:04.340
Lovely little tale
of brotherly love.

00:50:05.775 --> 00:50:08.644
The Hound was just a pup,

00:50:08.678 --> 00:50:11.079
six years old maybe.

00:50:11.113 --> 00:50:13.315
Gregor a few years older—

00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:16.785
already a big lad, already
getting a bit of a reputation.

00:50:16.819 --> 00:50:19.254
Some lucky boys

00:50:19.288 --> 00:50:22.457
just born with a talent
for violence.

00:50:23.826 --> 00:50:27.129
One evening Gregor found
his little brother

00:50:27.163 --> 00:50:29.799
playing with a toy by the fire—

00:50:29.833 --> 00:50:32.034
Gregor's toy,

00:50:32.068 --> 00:50:34.470
a wooden knight.

00:50:34.504 --> 00:50:36.972
Gregor never said a word,

00:50:37.007 --> 00:50:39.775
he just grabbed his brother
by the scruff of his neck

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:43.012
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

00:50:43.046 --> 00:50:45.281
Held him there

00:50:45.315 --> 00:50:47.283
while the boy screamed,

00:50:47.317 --> 00:50:49.718
while his face melted.

00:50:53.823 --> 00:50:56.592
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

00:50:56.627 --> 00:50:59.295
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.

00:50:59.329 --> 00:51:01.230
No, please don't.

00:51:01.265 --> 00:51:03.699
If the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

00:51:03.733 --> 00:51:06.735
I'm afraid all the knights
in King's Landing

00:51:06.769 --> 00:51:09.104
would not be able to save you.

00:51:21.748 --> 00:51:24.850
My Lord, Her Grace the Queen.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.522
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

00:51:30.556 --> 00:51:33.124
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

00:51:35.161 --> 00:51:38.363
I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us—

00:51:38.397 --> 00:51:40.632
the ugliness with the wolves.

00:51:42.802 --> 00:51:45.404
And forcing you to kill
the beast was extreme.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.143
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

00:51:51.578 --> 00:51:53.379
How is Sansa?

00:51:53.414 --> 00:51:55.315
She likes it here.

00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:57.083
She's the only Stark who does.

00:51:57.118 --> 00:51:59.619
Favors her mother,

00:51:59.653 --> 00:52:01.421
not much of the North in her.

00:52:01.455 --> 00:52:04.858
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.

00:52:04.892 --> 00:52:07.060
What is it you
hope to accomplish?

00:52:07.094 --> 00:52:10.163
The King called on me
to serve him and the realm,

00:52:10.198 --> 00:52:12.932
and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

00:52:12.967 --> 00:52:15.434
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

00:52:15.469 --> 00:52:18.037
He'll do what he wants, which is
all he's ever done.

00:52:18.071 --> 00:52:21.039
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

00:52:21.074 --> 00:52:23.809
If that's my job, then so be it.

00:52:25.311 --> 00:52:27.747
You're just a soldier,
aren't you?

00:52:27.781 --> 00:52:30.516
You take your orders
and you carry on.

00:52:31.552 --> 00:52:33.719
I suppose it makes sense.

00:52:33.754 --> 00:52:37.090
Your older brother was trained to
lead and you were trained to follow.

00:52:37.124 --> 00:52:40.092
I was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.

00:52:43.531 --> 00:52:45.632
As was I.

00:53:03.516 --> 00:53:05.484
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

00:53:05.518 --> 00:53:07.853
And to you.

00:53:07.887 --> 00:53:09.854
Boy!
Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

00:53:09.889 --> 00:53:12.290
Ah, good idea, grandfather.
I'm starving.

00:53:12.324 --> 00:53:14.125
A song while we wait or—?

00:53:14.159 --> 00:53:15.960
I'd rather throw myself
down a well.

00:53:15.994 --> 00:53:19.630
Now now, grandfather, this may be your
last chance if you're heading North.

00:53:19.665 --> 00:53:22.667
The only music the Northerners know is
the howling of wolves!

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.437
Gods.

00:53:26.471 --> 00:53:27.972
I'm sorry, My Lord.
We're full up.

00:53:28.006 --> 00:53:31.008
- Every room.
- My men can sleep in the stable.

00:53:31.043 --> 00:53:33.678
As for myself, I don't
require a large room.

00:53:33.712 --> 00:53:36.881
Truly, My Lord, we have nothing.

00:53:36.915 --> 00:53:39.250
Is there nothing I can do...

00:53:39.284 --> 00:53:41.853
...To remedy this?

00:53:41.887 --> 00:53:43.755
You can have my room.

00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:45.323
Now there's a clever man.

00:53:47.226 --> 00:53:49.961
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

00:53:49.995 --> 00:53:52.097
- Aye, My Lord.
- My Lord of Lannister!

00:53:52.131 --> 00:53:54.232
Might I entertain you
while you eat?

00:53:54.266 --> 00:53:57.168
I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

00:53:57.202 --> 00:53:59.836
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

00:54:00.805 --> 00:54:02.472
Lady Stark!

00:54:02.506 --> 00:54:05.208
What an unexpected pleasure.

00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:08.778
I was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

00:54:08.813 --> 00:54:10.680
Lady Stark!

00:54:18.522 --> 00:54:20.690
I was still Catelyn Tully

00:54:20.725 --> 00:54:23.226
the last time I stayed here.

00:54:25.597 --> 00:54:28.365
You, Ser,

00:54:28.399 --> 00:54:32.636
is that the black bat of Harrenhal
I see embroidered on your coat?

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:34.705
It is, My Lady.

00:54:34.739 --> 00:54:37.575
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest friend

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:41.413
to my father, Lord Hoster Tully
of Riverrun?

00:54:41.448 --> 00:54:43.216
She is.

00:54:45.352 --> 00:54:48.721
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

00:54:48.755 --> 00:54:50.957
My father counts Jonas Bracken

00:54:50.991 --> 00:54:54.093
amongst his oldest
and most loyal bannermen.

00:54:54.127 --> 00:54:55.995
Our lord is honored by his trust.

00:54:56.029 --> 00:54:58.331
I envy your father

00:54:58.365 --> 00:55:00.032
all his fine friends, Lady Stark,

00:55:00.067 --> 00:55:03.136
but I don't quite see
the purpose of this.

00:55:04.938 --> 00:55:07.006
I know your sigil as well—

00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:10.710
The Twin Towers of Frey.

00:55:10.745 --> 00:55:13.013
How fares your lord, Ser?

00:55:13.047 --> 00:55:15.015
Lord Walder is well, My Lady.

00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:17.851
He has asked your father
for the honor of his presence

00:55:17.885 --> 00:55:19.453
on his 90th nameday.

00:55:19.487 --> 00:55:21.755
He plans to take another wife.

00:55:28.463 --> 00:55:30.932
This man

00:55:30.966 --> 00:55:33.301
came into my house as a guest

00:55:33.335 --> 00:55:37.237
and there conspired
to murder my son,

00:55:37.272 --> 00:55:40.775
a boy of 10.

00:55:42.377 --> 00:55:45.646
In the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

00:55:45.681 --> 00:55:48.449
I call upon you to seize him

00:55:48.483 --> 00:55:52.053
and help me return him
to Winterfell

00:55:52.087 --> 00:55:54.122
to await the King's Justice.
